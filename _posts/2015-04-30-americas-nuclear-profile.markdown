The energy crisis cannot be stopped if we keep doing what we’re doing now.  The use of coal and other fossil fuels is only furthering the draining of Earth’s resources and causing pollution.  If these problems get any worse, the world could begin to change for the worse.  That’s why we need to buy small modular reactors to help power the United States, for cleaner energy, cheaper energy, and more widespread energy.

It is essential to buy these SMRs because they do not emit greenhouse gases.  If we want to try to stop the breaking down of the ozone layer, we need to cut down on our greenhouse gas emissions.  They also pose a health issue.  Nuclear power is much safer for the environment.

Small modular reactors can also provide cheaper and easier energy.  The parts are made in factories, so there is less on-site construction.  They are simpler, faster, and they can easily be upgraded with new parts as more energy is needed.  They also cost less up front to build, because of the cheaper production of factories.  They are able to be designed to work for a long time with no refueling and have long refueling cycles.  These SMRs can be accommodated for many situations.

SMRs can be implemented in areas that are too small to have their own power plants.  They produce less energy, but they are more efficient than many existing forms of energy now, which is perfect for smaller areas.  They can even be transported to other areas that need them.

So, for safer, cheaper, and more widespread energy, we need to buy SMRs.  Just like any invention, they continue to be redesigned and improved to be the best source of energy.  Switching to SMRs can help bring the US into an area of efficient nuclear energy.
