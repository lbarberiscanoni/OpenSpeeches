The current primary election system only allows establishment democrats and establishment republicans to win who don’t represent truly represent the people, this is a problem but the issue is much more than just primary elections. I urge a vote in the negation until we come up with comprehensive election reform. In this speech I will layout how primary elections are just the tip of the iceberg and as such removing them only hides the real root of the problem. Since this resolution doesn’t solve the problem we should hold out for comprehensive solutions because this resolution is a copout and we need real reform. 

Gerrymandering is defined by Oxford dictionaries as to “manipulate the boundaries of (an electoral constituency) so as to favor one party or class”. A look at a map of districts in the United States will show some of the weirdest and disjointed districts imaginable, this brings serious ramifications and if you don’t believe me that gerrymandering exists search Illinois Congressional district 4 or the so called pinwheel of death in Maryland. What truly causes such a lack of representation of the people is not a system where democrats pick democrats or republicans pick republicans it’s the system that politicians pick you. John Mackenzie from the University of Delaware explains Gerrymandering “The party in control of redistricting can weaken the opposition party by “packing” as many opposition voters as possible into a minimum number of conceded districts, and/or “cracking” opposition voters among numerous safe districts where they are in the minority. If representatives are required to be residents of their districts, redistricting may “hijack” a district from an incumbent by redrawing the boundary to exclude his house, and/or “kidnap” him into a district where he will lose the next election.”

To paraphrase one political party will redraw districts to guarantee that they will hold on to a majority of seats and simultaneously remove the opposition. The best way is in my opinion to have fair elections is to implement a shortest split-line where the population is divided by the shortest line that splits the residency in half until the desired populations is reached, ensuring no bias.

In order to actually solve the problem this bill addresses we need to real changes, not encouragement. I urge a vote in the negation until we have real reform.
