Let me begin by first doing what no other affirmative speaker has been able to do: define “untested medications” and then I will explain why you should also support this bill. 

First, because of the recent Ebola outbreak, the World Health Organization turned to what they referred to as “untested medication”.  They defined it as any medication which has not cleared Phase 1 testing.  The US national library of medication defines phase 1 testing as “Researchers test a new drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.” This medication has already been tested on animals such as primates, which our DNA is extremely similar. This isn’t your teenage neighbor bobby selling you his acne cream for your cancer, this a group of dedicated reseachers and scientist working on a cure or vaccine for your disease. 

And secondly, I stand in favor of today’s bill because I refuse to let the government have the power to impose such a choice on the American people. Our constituents are free people, and this legislation supports that.
When someone is diagnosed with a life threatening disease their days are numbered, unfortunately there is no number for the ineffienciency of this government and there is no due by date for the approval of medication. So our constituents will watch the sand in their hourglass fall waiting for faceless officials to approve what they need.
People have a right to fight for their lives: they also have a right to their body. Provided proper consent and decision-making. And yes being in the scenario they are in provides extra stress and they may make a decision they wouldn’t normally make. That doesn’t make their decision wrong. Often times the fight or flight instinct saves human lives, we should not limit rights just because someone chooses to fight.

Beyond the emotional reasons, we here as a government should do what good governments do and recognize property rights. Professor Armen Alchian from the University of California, Los Angelos, writes in his book “Private property rights are the rights of humans to use specified goods and to exchange them” and “Any restraint on them shifts the balance of power toward behavior that political authorities approve.” In other words someone’s property is their own and they can do what they want to with it, otherwise we are depriving individuals of themselves; Therefore we should accept their right to decide what is best for them.

So to conclude we have a decision to make, to vote for or against this bill, on one hand is a pro-life and pro-choice argument on the other hand is an authoritarian government’’’. To protect the citizenry of both their life and their choice please affirm this bill.
