To be truly honest, when I first heard about today’s legislation, I developed a series of childish responses like “I want to be blunt with you” and  “we need a joint effort”. Truth be told, until very recently I thought MJ was spelled Mary-UNA. Clearly, I am far from an expert: my knowledge pretty much comes from Nancy from Weeds and Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad. The one thing I do know is that we can no longer avoid the issue of Marijuana legalization; because our constituents demand a straightforward answer on such a divisive political issue. I stand before you today against the legislation, out of the respect I have the states’ right to decide the legal status of Marijuana.

I oppose on the today’s bill on the grounds of the separation of powers. In passing today’s legislation, and federally decriminalizing Marijuana, we as Congress would be assuming a constitutional power we simply do not possess. In US v. Morrison the Supreme Court ruled that “it is undeniable that our founding father’s gave police power to the states and not the federal government”. Thus the power to legislate the safety, health, and morality of our constituents lies not within us but with the states that we each represent in this room, and US v Sprague explains “the 10th amendment prevents the federal government from gaining power unless specifically granted by the constitution”, thus the commerce clause cannot be used to supersede the authority of the states when it comes down to a question of police power, and that’s why today’s legislation undermines one of the core principles of the country we stand for.

On a broader level, I oppose the legislation on moral grounds. As I have begun struggling with my own addiction to caffeine, I have come to realize that a loss of control of one’s body undermines the core of a healthy society. I do however respect the right of the state of Colorado to decriminalize marijuana, and much in the same way I ask you to respect the right of my fellow South Carolinians to pursue a healthy society in the way they best see fit. Today’s legislation does neither, for it allows the federal government to arbitrarily speak to a personal issue that should be dealt on a state level.
