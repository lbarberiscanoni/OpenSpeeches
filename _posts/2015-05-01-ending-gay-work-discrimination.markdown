Right now, cases involving sexual orientation and gender identity have hard time proving discrimination because either the LGBT individual is the only one suffering harm, or everyone else is coerced under the threat of firing into not coming forward. In Amchem Products v Windsor, the Supreme Court explains that “the CRA of 1964 allows every other class of individuals to sue as a single plaintiff if the suit meets the grounds of commonality.” This is critical, because a class action protects victims of discrimination from abusive legal maneuvers and corporate intimidation. Today’s legislation puts a stop to that, by shielding the LGBT community by easing the process of filing as a class action.

Furthermore, today’s reform is critical in preventing corporations from undermining the process of pre-trial discovery. Discovery is the procedure by which the facts of the case are revealed, to accurately assess the merit of the civil suit. Antonin Scalia, I know: my wild roommate at Harvard Law, speaks unanimously for the court in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services that “same sex sexual harassment is prohibited under Title VII of the CRA of 1964”. US law already acknowledges that the spirit of equal protection under the 14th amendment extends to the LGBT community, and today’s legislation codifies this noble principle by affording under Landeros v. Flood the ability to provide immunity to witnesses coming forward during discovery. 

GAO July 31 meta-analysis of a data from all 50 states from 2007 to 2012 shows “employment discrimination complaints based on sexual orientation and gender identity were overall fewer than those on race, gender and religion.”
