US intervention only disrupts this process of national emergence by escalating the violence within the region as we have seen in Sierra Leon, Congo and Uganda. This is empirically demonstrated by a meta-analysis of 17 interventions in six countries in the last 20 years done by Taylor Seybolt, from the University of Pittsburgh,:
	“Humanitarian interventions tend to prolong conflicts by supplying resources to local fighting forces that don't conclusively end the conflict and by incentivizing dependency on humanitarian aid as an excuse for not taking political action to stop the war”. 

Cristopher Layne, prof. @ Texas A&M School of Government in his book “American Empire: A Debate”
	"Terrorism really is a form of asymmetric warfare waged against the United States by groups that lack the resources to directly engage and compel the US to withdraw military forces from their homeland. 

Robert Pape, Director of the UChicago Project on Security and Terrorism, 
	“Over 95% of all suicide attacks are in response to foreign occupation, and 90% of all suicide attacks are now anti-American.”
