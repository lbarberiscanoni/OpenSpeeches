The latest report from the Pentagon paints an outrageously horrible picture of the grim reality of military rape: contrary to popular belief, men are the largest victims of sexual abuse. They are 15, 15!, times more likely to be raped by a fellow officer than killed by an enemy. But it is stories such as that of Jeremiah Arbogast, and his attempted suicide as an escape from the traumatic event that scarred him for life, that put a face to this issue too often ignored. 
It is his plight, and that of 26k other soldiers, victims of sexual assault last year alone, that forces us today to reconcile the unique practical concerns of our military with our moral thirst for justice. But today’s legislation is a remedial, and not preventative approach towards fighting military rape. It thus posits a question of the process used to deal with the aftermath of military rape, which is why I stand to uphold the integrity of the military justice system. 
In Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, our founding fathers reserved to us the power “To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces”. They understood that whether in active combat or deployed abroad, our military is constituted of extraordinary men and women entrusted with the extraordinary task to protect our rights. As such, the particular context and challenges of land and naval forces has grounded the creation of a separate legal system than that of the civilian world. Because each soldier, each platoon and each base needs to be prepared for action at any and every moment.

What the affirmation wants is change: they want the privileges afforded to civilians to be extended to victims of sexual abuse in the military. However, the establishment of a civilian option to try sexual crimes not only breeds legal inequality by excluding such option for equally heinous crimes such as murder and torture, but also breaks down the very flexibility that allows our deployed troops to be prepared to neutralize national security threats at all times.

The true solution to our dilemma lies not in blending the civilian and military system, but rather in coordinated efforts between the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies such as the NCIS, whose efforts are specifically tailored to the difficult situations of the military world. Undercover investigations and procedural reviews of upper officers effectively shed light on these crimes without breaking down the chain of command of our military.
