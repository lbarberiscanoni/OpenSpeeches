(The speech of course changed a lot bc I was refuting and stuff, but inro was in finals at Emory so lots of inside jokes and references to people there)

Senator Wishner, you know what makes me "go postal"?? Your FACE!!! Just kidding XD What makes me REALLY go postal is senator Wang saying stuff like "we don't need paper to operate as a congress". (In a sassy way) Nah ah (finger included)! We totally need paper to operate as a congress! And it's not the paper that senator Mascaro uses to roll his joints with the weed we legalized last night, but it's the US constitution! Which is why I stand here today to protect it. 

First of all, section 3 takes reduction in force reforms off of the Union negotiating table. The Supreme Court explains in NLRB v Jones & Laughlin Steel  that “the right of employees to self-organization for the purpose of collective bargain is an essential condition for industrial peace and is thus constitutional protected”. Thus USPS unions have the right to use collective bargaining to prevent people from being fired, and today’s legislation restricts that right.

Most importantly, section 3 also prevents unions from negotiating pay and benefits, for they will be set to equivale those of the private sector. The Supreme court ruled in Duplex Printing Press v. Deering  that “the Clayton Act protects the existence of lawful union activities” therefore collective bargaining cannot be restricted unless it’s illegal, and the Supreme ruled in  Apex Hosiery v. Leader “the elimination of price competition is the legitimate objective of any labor organization”
