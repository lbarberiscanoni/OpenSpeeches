Helps meet growing demand for fresh fruits and vegetables. Roberta Cook of UC Davis’s Department of Agriculture and Resource Economics writes in March 2013 that "sales of fresh-cut and organic produce have been consistently increasing over the last few years."

The issue is current farm policy, which heavily subsidizes meat and commodity crops but not fruits and vegetables. And as environmental journalist Ben Goldfarb writes, "the ones backing these policies are big fruit and vegetable agribusinesses that don’t want to compete with regional fresh produce farmers."

As Jack Hedin, Minnesota vegetable farmer, states “national fruit and vegetable businesses in California, Florida, and Texas are monopolizing fresh produce under government policy that discourages local farmers. The ones who end up suffering are the consumers. This legislation allows local farmers like Jack Hedin to compete in fruit/veg. market.

Addresses negative externalities of the meat and animal feed industry The current meat industry has significant drawbacks beyond just an inefficient diet. Union for Concerned Scientists writes in October 2013 that “Farm policies have incentivized monocultures of feed crops like corn and soybeans that rely on heavy use of fertilizer and pesticide as well as large-scale, inefficient livestock production.” Resulting in “poor soil, polluted air and water, and even reduced property value.”

These costs add up. Sustainability lawyer David Simon states in his 2013 book Meatonomics that the total negative externalized costs of the meat and feed industry are over $414 billion dollars. Current system incentivizes inefficiency and waste.
