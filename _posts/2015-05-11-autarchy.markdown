A responsible government uses the democratic process and public input to understand and best respond to policy questions. By discussing policy issues “post-facto” IE talking about what the world would look like after the policy is implemented, we never talk about the process it takes to approve ideas, thereby undermining the democratic process because we become spectators analyzing the consequences of what our government does as opposed to active participants.
