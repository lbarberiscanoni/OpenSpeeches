Capitalism dehumanizes people, because it does not think of them as complex, individual persons but rather as "consumers" to be manipulated into making purchases or working for minimal rewards. The capitalist ethic reduces people to things, and must be rejected so we can transcend the impulse to treat all things and all people as commodities.
