Constructivism is unique among the theories listed here because it can be used to explain internal political processes as well as foreign relations. It comes from an article entitled "Anarchy is What States Make of It" by Alexander Wendt. It may be available on the internet, and I know that it has been published in several journals and textbooks, one of which is entitled International Organization: A Reader, edited by Friederich Kratochwil and Edward D. Mansfield. Following are the major premises of constructivism:

Past interactions set the precedent for future interaction. . This simple statement is very important for extempers because of its accuracy. The past quite obviously does effect the present, so when you write speeches about how two countries or organizations will relate to one another, you should include some mention of their history together. According to Wendt, nations, international organizations, and ethnic groups are very slow to forget history. Ethnic conflict continues unabated because of a long history of fighting, Russia is threatened by NATO because NATO was created to counter the USSR's expansion, and Iran is hostile toward the US because it helped perpetuate the Shah's unjust rule. History, however, is not inescapable, something which Wendt explains in his next theorem, which explains how nations change their interactions. 

The three stages of change in international relations: 

1. Breakdown of consensus about national identity This prong of the theory assumes that some domestic change is necessary to change foreign policy. These changes are often prompted by some kind of crisis. The best example of this process is the breakup of the Soviet Union. The USSR's identity centered on the superiority of communism over capitalism and the belief that interactions between communists and capitalists were inherently conflictual. A domestic economic crisis, however, caused the communist government to become vastly unpopular. The people demanded change.

2. Creating a new identity This is a process of creating new national identities which will impact both foreign and domestic policy. It is an extension of the first step. In the case of the USSR, it required continued domestic political and economic reforms. In addition, both the United States and Russia had to change behaviors that lead to negative interactions, like stockpiling arms. 

3. Changing interactions with other states For lasting change to occur, other countries must be willing to support the country. For instance: If the international community continued to isolate Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, democratic change could not have occurred because Russians would have seen few political and economic benefits in transforming their government. Though the people might gain new freedoms, their new government could not survive if isolated from the international community. This is the premise behind sanctions and embargoes--when the US believes that a country has changed in a negative manner, they refuse to support the change by interacting with the country positively. 

Note how these 3 steps look conveniently like 3 areas of analysis for an extemp or congress speech. It would work best for a question like "Is China becoming more liberal?" or "Will Iran relax its strict Muslim laws?"
