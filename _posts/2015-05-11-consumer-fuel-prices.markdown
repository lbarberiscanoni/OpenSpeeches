I applaud the affirmative on their arguments.  They have the right goals in mind, because there are problems that need to be solved by raising fuel prices.  However, the means by which they hope to achieve these goals are as impotent as they are inefficient.  Instead of requiring the fuel companies to set a minimum price, I propose that the government put higher taxes on fuel so that the government can benefit from fuel more, but still keep all of the other benefits stated by the affirmative.

The main reason people want to raise the price of gas is to make people drive less, and thus help the environment.  But the ones who benefit from this bill are the oil companies.  If we really want the price to be raised to a specific amount, the government could make up the difference through increased taxes.  Furthermore, the money raised from these taxes would be used for the development of better, more environmentally friendly kinds of energy.  That way, in the long run, these fuels could be more available for a cheaper price, thus encouraging more people to drive without further damage to the environment.  The way things are going now, a change has to happen.  We canâ€™t trust the people to change by themselves, so we have to create a way to make them change.  Eventually, the people will have to buy the cheaper, more efficient kinds of energy that will in turn fix the problems for which the bill was written.

What the bill says right now is for oil companies to be required to make more money.  While less gas may be sold because of the higher price, people always need to drive.  If money is to be made, then it should be for the government, who can make good use of it by investing in our common interests rather than the money being for private companies that will use it for their own interests.

I agree that the price of fuel should be raised, but it should be done in a way that benefits the economy and the earth, rather than requiring the fuel companies to make even more money.  Through this alternate method, we can eventually make a cleaner, more environmental America.
