Advocates say that one of the key reasons for U.S. intervention in other nations is that it reinforces a climate of peace that bolsters democratic traditions. This would seem to be a good thing, right? This kritik says no. Democracy is predicated on the belief that the opinions of hundreds of people are all more likely to be correct than the opinions of one person. Is there any evidence that this has ever been the case? Instead, we see that the prejudices of the majority become the policies of the government; those citizens who have overcome these prejudices are isolated from power. Elected officials inevitably cultivate special interests which can deliver votes to keep them in power. Democracy is the most oppressive form of government, because the lone voice of dissent is helpless against the tyranny of the majority. Ex. Esther Pryne in â€œThe Scarlet Letter, gays during the 80s, and African-Americans pretty much all throughout US History.
