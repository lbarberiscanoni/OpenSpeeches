Threats are morally equivalent to violence. If it is wrong to kill, it is wrong to intend to kill even if you are stopped and it is wrong to sincerely threaten to kill because that just publicizes your evil intention. But sincere threats are the keystone of deterrence policy. If it is wrong to use nuclear weapons in war (and almost all philosophers believe it is), then it is wrong to intend to use nuclear weapons and wrong to threaten to do so. Thus, possessing nuclear weapons is in itself a passive threat and thus morally wrong. But deterrence is not only nuclear. Is it wrong to let an innocent person suffer, or even starve? Everyone says yes. If that is so, then it is wrong to impose economic sanctions on a nation if those sanctions might result in starvation or deprivation. By the logic above, even threatening economic sanctions is equally as wrong.
