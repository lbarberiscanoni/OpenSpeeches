The kritik claims that the "critical feminist" stance is intrinsically divisive and incoherent. Feminism claims there are inescapable differences between men and women in modes of thought and in being. At the same time, feminism purports to believe in equality across gender lines. In practical terms, it makes that goal of cooperative equality unattainable, by denying that men’s thoughts and feelings have parity with those of women. Indeed, rather than abolishing hierarchies, critical feminism merely wants the women’s position to be given precedence. The only way to work toward the ideal of equality is to reject the mindset of critical feminism. Accepting arguments based on a feminist perspective would undermine that effort, so the team adopting the feminist position must lose the round of debate.
