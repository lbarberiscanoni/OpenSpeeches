Hegemonic stability theory is a subset of realism. A hegemon is a country that is much more powerful than all of the nations in the international system. When a hegemon exists, the balance of power is said to be unipolar . One example of a hegemon is Great Britain before the first World War--is colonial empire gave it vast wealth and consequently much more power than other nations. Some people think that the United States is a hegemon today. HST is designed primarily to explain the workings of international organizations. Hegemons create and finance international organizations to spread their ideals and values thoughout the international system and to solidify their grasp on power. Only hegemons can afford to create international organizations because only they can finance them. Other states join the organization because they believe that an alliance with the most powerful state in the world is to their benefit.

According to popular though in hegemonic stability theory, the hegemon (or the most powerful state in the world, even if it is not powerful enough to be a hegemon)remains in power for 100 years There are four distinct phases during its leadership: 

1. Global War Global war does not have to be a war in the traditional sense--it could also be a trade war large enough to significantly change the world's economy. Typically, these global wars are gought between groups with very different ideas of how the world ought to be ordered (sound like World War II to anyone?) 

2. World Leadership In this phase, the winner of the war establishes international organizations. According to Kelly-Kate Pease in International Organizations , these organizations help the new hegemon institutionalize its vision of thew orld order and legitimize its position as the world leader. People who believe that the United States is a hegemon point out that it took the lead role in creating the UN after WWII. Because it was the only one of the victor nations that did not experience significant fighting on its home soil, its finances were much much stronger than that of any other victor country. 

3. Deligitimation During this phase, the hegemon begins to lose power and rising states challenge its authority to lead. Some people believe that this is happening to the United States right now--for instance, France often does not back US intervention in foreign countries and nations like Iran, Iraq, and Russia have also questioned the United States' history of interventionist politics. 

4. Deconcentration The world leader uses force to maintain its domination. This, in turn, hastens the end of hegemony because military confrontations are expensive to finance. Those who believe that the United States is a declining hegemon point out that it must increasingly utilize the military to enforce its values--other states don't simply go along with the US because it is powerful. An example is the United States' frequent bombing of Iraq. It is important to note, however, that the decline of a hegemon is not enough to completely destroy the world order--there must also be another power with a different viewpoint who is willing to change the system. In addition, many other countries must be dissatisfied with the status quo; if they are not, they will form alliances to defeat the new hegemon and maintain the current world order.
