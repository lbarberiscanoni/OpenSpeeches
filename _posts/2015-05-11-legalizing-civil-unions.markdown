This legislation is extremely out of touch with states. At a time when everyone is discussing gay marriage, this Amendment is legalizing civil unions. There are only 3 states – Colorado, Nevada, and Wisconsin – that allow civil unions right now, mainly because civil unions are pointless in the 19 states where gay marriage is already legal.   

And as a Washington post article from May 26 states, "a diverse group of federal judges across the country have struck down gay marriage bans, demonstrating that gay marriage in America is here to stay." This Amendment doesn’t make sense because it’s meaningless in the 22 states with either gay marriage or civil unions, and then it forces the other 28 states to adopt civil unions. This doesn’t make anyone happy, and I don’t see any way this would get ratified by 3/4 of the state legislatures. 

This Amendment creates legal confusion and inconsistency. A civil union is legally different than a marriage in multiple ways. Marriages are legally respected the same way state by state, but civil unions are recognized differently by different states; some states extend the same rights as a marriage for a civil union while other states only extend some. 

Thus, this amendment would open the door for a huge amount of inconsistency while not really guaranteeing much progress since states decide how they want to legally recognize a civil union. 

Moreover, currently the federal government only recognizes marriages, not civil unions, for federal protections and benefits. So this amendment advances a construct that we as the federal government don’t even recognize.
