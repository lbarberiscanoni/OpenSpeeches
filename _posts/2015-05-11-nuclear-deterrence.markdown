Reality is socially constructed. What this means that the limits of what we perceive as possible or desirable are bounded by what we as humans acknowledge in our thinking and our discourse (broadly, our writing and speech). Talking about nuclear war or nuclear weapons, in this view, allows us to think about mass murder intellectually, without engaging our emotions or our moral sense; in turn, such talk desensitizes us to the prospect of using such horrible weapons. Bringing up the idea of nuclear war in a debate is actually making such war more likely, by making the prospect of nuclear war less "unthinkable."
