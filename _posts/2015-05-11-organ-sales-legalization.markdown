This legislation would de-incentivize illegal organ trafficking. As the Harvard Global Health Review notes, "the international organ trade is a booming enterprise that makes 1.2 billion dollars annually in profits. But it’s also a practice that takes advantage of the most vulnerable groups of people."

As the UN Office on drugs and crime states, organ trafficking primarily happens in 3 ways. First, someone is forced or deceived into giving up their organs. Second, victims agree to sell organs, although they usually end up being cheated. And third, victims are treated for something and organs are removed without their knowledge.  

It’s significant because our country is a major reason illegal trade is booming. According to the American Transplant Foundation; "this year there were over 120,000 on the US waiting list for organs." Legalizing organ sales helps solve the trafficking problem because it takes away the incentive to illegally sell organs; there’s no reason for people to break the law in order to pay more for an organ than through legal means.

US already has the infrastructure for an organ market. Only one nation currently has legalized organ sales: Iran. And in the Irani system there isn’t direct interaction between organ venders and buyers. Rather, there’s an intermediary organization that venders express their interest to. This organization evaluates vendors based on the same standards used for living organ donors, and then pairs up organ vendors and organ buyers. This setup minimizes the potential of exploitation or abuse of organ vendors.  

The US can easily adopt a similar system. As a CATO institute policy analysis states, in the US organ procurement organizations already function like Iran’s intermediary organization with deceased donors. Legalizing the organ trade only means expanding their role. Additionally, the US is much better equipped than Iran to take good care of organ vendors because of our larger and more advanced healthcare.
