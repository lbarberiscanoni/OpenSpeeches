Larry Swilling, a man from Anderson, South  Carolina, my home state. Walked 250 miles down a road wearing a sandwich sign that read “NEED KIDNEY FOR WIFE”. This is the state we live in senators, one that drives us to desperation to hunt for organs. By passing today’s legislation we can address the shortage of  organs within the United States. 

Iran is the only country where the selling and buying of kidneys is legal. As a result, there is no shortage of the organs. According to the Guardian on May 27th, 2012 "Iran's controversial kidney procurement system, allows people to sell and buy kidneys under the state-regulated surveillance of two non-profit organizations, the CASKP and the Charity Foundation for Special Diseases. These charities facilitate the process by finding potential vendors and introducing them to the recipients, and are charged with checking the compatibility of a possible donation and ensuring a fair trade."

After the transplant, the vendor is compensated by both the government and the recipient. "In 2010, a total of 2,285 kidney transplants took place in the country, of which 1,690 kidneys were supplied from volunteers and 595 from those clinically brain-dead," he said. 

Dr Benjamin Hippen, a transplant nephrologist with the Carolinas medical centre in North Carolina, US, has studied successes, deficiencies and the ambiguities of the Iranian system. “It is increasingly clear that there are many different systems, rather than a single unified system in Iran.That said, Iran appears to have successfully addressed the shortage of organs, incentives for organs have not substantially attenuated the growth and development of organ procurement from deceased donors, and reported outcomes for recipients have been favourable."

In the US, more than 100,000 people were estimated to be on the waiting list for kidney transplants in 2010 – waiting lists were eliminated in Iran in 1999.Hippen has pointed out that "since 1999, more than 30,000 US patients with kidney failure have died waiting for an organ that never arrived".
