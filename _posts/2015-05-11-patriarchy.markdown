Political and governmental decisions, particularly at the federal level, are almost always being made by men. Thus the governmental establishment is a means to perpetuating the second-class citizenship of women not only in the United States, but throughout the world. Working within the system blinds us to the possibility of breaking free from male domination. 

In the case of foreign affairs, any consideration of international relations is really gendered discourse, because it is heavily dependent on masculine ideas of military strength and weaponry. The foreign relations process is tainted with the masculine ideals of "how things are done": rationalism, causal reasoning, and certainty. A masculine view of international relations makes war inevitable (it’s a testosterone thing). Acting through conventional tools of international relations means a confirmation of the global patriarchy that oppresses women. 

For example, the whole idea of "control" in the phrase "arms control” resonates with a masculinist viewpoint because it buys into the dominance and submission perspective which underscores all relations between the sexes within our patriarchal system. It denies the opportunity for engagement and the use of a mutual, evolutionary dialogue among all parties to reach a conclusion that satisfies everyone.
