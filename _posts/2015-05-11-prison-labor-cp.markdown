Expanding infantry is counterproductive. Center for Research on Globalization March 2014 "97% of 125,000 federal inmates are non-violent – this bill affects over 100,000 people.""

Infantry is by definition ground force, and there’s just no need for a large ground force right now.A Senior Pentagon Official is quoted in NYT Feb 23 stating “You can’t carry a large land war defense department hen there is no large land war.” Moreover, Gordon Adams, FP professor at American U, states that "cutting the infantry makes sense because a land force is the easiest to regenerate."

This legislation also sends prisoners where they aren’t needed. The Pentagon is already planning to shrink army from 500,000 to 450,000.

Prison labor is a better place for prisoners. As supporters of this bill have argued, cost and efficiency are perhaps the biggest problems right now with our prisons. Prison labor directly addresses both of these. 

First, prison labor helps offset high incarceration costs. An example we can turn to is the Canon City Correctional Complex in Southern Colorado, where over 8,000 prisoners help run a fish farming program where every working inmate saves taxpayers $5,000 per year (Director Steve Smith)

Second, prison labor makes prisons more efficient because it helps prisoners lead successful lives after prison. 2009 study from Georgia State on federal prison labor states that "prison labor empirically decreases recidivism, increases employment duration, and increases wage potential."
