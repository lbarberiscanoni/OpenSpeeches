This kind of regulation is impossible to enforce. First, Bitcoin is fundamentally untraceable. Bitcoin addresses indicate nothing about a person’s actual identity.Transactions aren’t IP traceable because according to Bitcoin’s own website clients relay all users’ transactions just like their own. Endless number of extra privacy measures like the TOR anonymity network, converting Bitcoin into alternative coins, or something like Dark Wallet, a tool that combines Bitcoin transactions, making them completely untraceable.   

The only way an identity becomes known is if its voluntary or a result of carelessness. The punishment in this legislation is a fine, but it’s fundamentally impossible to determine who to fine. With bitcoin, if people want to stay anonymous, they will.

We should regulate Bitcoin on the business side of the transaction. Make your laws, a political action committee that takes bitcoin donation, stated on May 19 that “Because bitcoins are ultimately untraceable, preventive regulation at the outset of transaction is especially important.” In other words, we should regulate the business accepting the payments. For example, Make your laws requires bitcoin donators to prove they are not foreign nationals.  

This type of regulation can be achieved through Bit licenses, certificates required for Bitcoin businesses to operate. These licenses could require businesses to obtain identity information from consumers before carrying out a transaction. New York is actually currently poised to start a bit-license program; on March 11 the NY Department of Financial Services announced that they would begin accepting applications for bitlicenses. 

We don’t know who all bitcoin users are, but we do know who bitcoin businesses are, so our regulations should focus on them.
