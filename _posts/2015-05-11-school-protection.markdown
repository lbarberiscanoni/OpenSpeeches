Sometimes we need to fight fire with fire.  With controlled burns, firemen burn possible wildfire fuel before it can actually cause a devastating fire.  With a preemptive action, we can actually prevent things from happening and reduce the need for the actual firefighting.  This bill does something similar to that, so we need to affirm this bill because it would help protect students, and uphold the law, which is their duty.

It’s a given that if teachers had means to defend themselves and their students, a lot less people would attack schools at the risk of being killed themselves.  The bill allows the option of having several protection officers, so if a teacher were to try to use the gun like the negation has been saying, then there would be other officers in the school to defend against that teacher.  In the time it takes for police to arrive, a shooter can shoot a great number of students and teachers.  The current lockdown drills just don’t cut it.  Locking the door and turning out the lights?  Hiding under a desk won’t protect anyone from a bullet, but action against the shooter will.

Now let’s talk more about these lockdown drills.  Teachers conduct many other drills like fire drills, tornado drills, etc.  Parents trust these teachers to protect their children in the event of a life threatening natural disaster, and also in the event of a dangerous person in the school.  Part of the teacher’s duty is to make sure the student is safe in any event, and this way they can definitely defend against shooters.

So why don’t the current police officers work?  Well, the issue lies in confidentiality.  According to NBC, the current laws that are in place in certain districts do not require the teachers to be open about having the guns.  This is what makes it so effective.  A shooter would know that there is an officer and target him or her.  The same applies for teachers who are open about their gun privilege.  They would be taken out first.  By being secret, they would have the element of surprise on their side.

These teachers would also be able to detain people.  Many teachers know about the illegal things going on in their schools, but they can rarely catch the kids and some teachers don’t even care.  If teachers had the power to detain students, then there would be a much slower spread of things like drugs or cigarettes at schools, and keep gang activity outside of school.  With the threat of an unknown teacher who can detain you at any time, illegal activities in schools would most likely decrease substantially.

The bottom line is, having school protection officers will protect our children, both from the immediate danger of attackers, and from unhealthy and illegal influences at school.  Schools need to be a safe place where kids are taught about the dangers of the world and where they can be sheltered from these things, so we need to affirm this bill to make sure these children have a chance to grow up and lead successful and fulfilling lives. Thank you.
