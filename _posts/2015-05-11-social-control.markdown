It is an innate property of organized society to establish a network of social control over a nation�s population. If there is not constant pressure to resist the trend, the net of social control will expand � usually, but not always, through the direct action of government. This is bad, for as social control expands, individual liberties diminish, and the core value of freedom itself is extinguished. Social control is innately (or, as philosophers would say, "deontologically": by the nature of its existence) evil.

The Negative kritik argues that the Affirmative plan will end the constant pressure against social control, and set us on the slippery slope toward tyranny. It does this by reinforcing the institution of compulsory education, which is the primary means by which society cages and confines adolescents � who are seen as dangerous, pre-human creatures. Affirmative case argumentation may actually feed this argument, if the Affirmative position is that education is important in instilling social rules, civic engagement, and good conduct in students.
