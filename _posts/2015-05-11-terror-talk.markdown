This is yet another variation on the Kritik of Rhetoric. One man�s "terrorist" is another man�s "freedom fighter." We have been conditioned to have an emotional response to the idea of terrorism � a response that short-circuits rational assessment. We can have no conception of people laboring under such great oppression that they resort to violence as their only means of calling attention to the situation. Instead, we label such people "terrorists" and use the fear that term evokes as justification for considering those people as less than fully human. Using the words "terrorist" and "terrorism" is an attempt at psychological manipulation of the audience � and an attempt to cover up the fact of true injustices afflicting these people. Obviously, then, debaters who start using these buzzwords should be chastised for their attempt to manipulate the debate process, and their arguments must be rejected in order to free us to develop a positive and inclusive future for all people.
