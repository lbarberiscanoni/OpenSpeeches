Any time we start talking about "security" and "conflict," we are being divisive. The very concept of security requires us to imagine an "other" � some group of people who are distinct from "us" � and then to construct for these others the role of "enemy." Even when we acknowledge privately that these are only potential enemies, we have still formed the mental picture of them as opponents. In other words, talking about security threats makes us consider other people as enemies, and then treat them as enemies, so that they respond by becoming enemies. Critics say that this process of constructing threats actually encourages war, because we are predisposed to take heroic action to vanquish our enemies, even though those people are usually only opposing us in our own minds. In debate, the team that begins talk about security threats is actually poisoning our minds, blinding us to the possibility of a truly universal community where nobody is excluded as an "other."
