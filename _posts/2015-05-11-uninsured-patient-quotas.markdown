Senators, my problem lies with section 1 of today’s legislation. Section 1 reads: “Hospital emergency rooms will no longer be able to deny patients because they are uninsured, regardless of whether or not the patient is in stable condition. “
What the author of today’s legislation fails to see is the benefit behind hospitals denying care to uninsured individuals. By denying care we are forcing individuals to look into establishing health insurance for themselves which should be a goal for this congress considering the passage of the ACA and Medicaid

Expansion of Medicaid has benefitted both hospitals and state governments. According to Daily KOS on May 8th, 2014 "A hospital group known as HCA, said that in the four states in which it operates that have expanded Medicaid, they'd seen a 29 percent decline in admissions of people without insurance, but a 5.9 increase in the non-expansion states."" A 29 percent decrease is pretty huge, meaning big savings for the hospitals, but also big savings for the local and state governments that won't have to figure out how to help the hospitals pay for all that uncompensated care. That's the big argument hospitals in all the states that didn't expand have been trying to make—Medicaid expansion makes sense not just because it means saving lives, because it also saves money.

By allowing hospitals to deny care we are 1. Increasing medicare/insurance sign ups and 2. Lowering the overall costs for hospitals and state governments. 
According to the NY Times on May 25th, 2014 ""By tightening requirements for charity care, hospital executives say, they hope to encourage eligible people to obtain low-cost insurance through the subsidized private plans now available under the law." This allows hospitals to use their own discretion in determining whether or not an individual can receive charity care. 

Southern New Hampshire Medical Center generally provided free or discounted care for patients who were at or below 225 percent of the poverty level, or about $26,260 for an individual. But starting this year, only patients below the poverty level will receive such charity care, said Paul Trainor, the system’s vice president of finance. Patients “who refuse to purchase federally mandated health insurance when they are eligible to do so will not be awarded charitable care,” the hospital’s revised policy states.
