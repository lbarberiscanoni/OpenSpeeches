This legislation does nothing to solve HR abuses in Iraq. A major sentiment expressed by supporters of this bill is that Iraq misuses the weapons we sell them by using them against domestic enemies and committing human rights abuses.  

But if that’s the problem then this bill doesn’t make much sense to me because first this bill doesn’t change the fact that Iraq already has US-bought weapons, and second this bill doesn’t take any action to actually stop the abuse from happening. 

Moreover, Iraq still has other ways to get weapons. According to a Reuters article this February, "Iraq signed off on 8 arms contracts with Iran totaling $195 million dollars. This was one month after the US blocked the sale of Apache helicopters to Iraq."" In other words, Iraq is clearly willing to purchase arms from other sources. This legislation would only have marginal impact on Iraqi use of arms and would probably drive Iraq closer towards other countries like Iran. 

This bill is unnecessary because congress can already shut down arms deals. There is a Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a corresponding committee in the house, and both must approve all arms sales to foreign countries. The blocked sale of Apache Helicopters I mentioned from January was the result of a decision from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee led by Chairman Robert Menendez to block the deal. I prefer this kind of case by case discretion overseen by a specialized team that probably knows more about foreign affairs than we do rather than the blanket legislation we have before us today.
