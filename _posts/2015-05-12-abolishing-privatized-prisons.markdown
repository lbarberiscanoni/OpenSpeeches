A Bill to End all Use of Privatized Prisons in the United States

We the people of the United States are infatuated with prison, just ask anyone with a Netflix account and they will start telling about "Orange in the new Black", in fact it is so present in America that despite the contrast there is relationship between Sesame Street and going to prison, Sesame Street has sketches where puppets talk about their parents being arrested in order to explain incarceration to children because it is so present in the united states.

Now I am not saying to stop watching Orange is the new Black because it is a good show, but New York times reports that the united states has the largest prison population in the world, in fact the united states only has roughly 5% of the worlds population but has 25% of the worlds imprisoned population.

So what causes this, is it the immensely successful (note the sarcasm) war on drugs or is it that, just straight up, Americans are more likely to be criminals. Well neither we have a relatively low crime rate and the war on drugs is a failure. So clearly there is a problem with our prison system.

In a report by the public interest organization it they found that 65% of all private prisons they investigated had a contract with either the state government or federal government that mandated the prison be at least 80% full at all times. Which means that states are contractually obligated to arrest people. And if they can't find enough criminals they have to find ways of arresting enough people.

A private prison is private business and so it is run like a business which means it needs resources so there is a demand humans, businesses need steady resources to produce anything, so there is a need for resources caused by a government and private investor making a deal to have power over people and deals between private prison and the judicial system like mandatory minimum sentencing and racial profiling help private prisons retain a high amount of resources.

(As a side note this isn't capitalism this is crony-capitalism, private prisons is a deal between government and a prison warden)

In our effort to be tough on crime we became tough on criminals.

We tend to view criminals as outsiders, not people like ourselves but people who have no relation to us. But todays prisoners are tomorrows neighbors so sure punishment has a place in the prison system but another piece of the pie needs to exist as well, rehabilitation. The social stigma of a convicted criminal, despite having served their time, restricts what they can do in their life. This causes high recidivism.

the tendency to relapse into a previous undesirable type of behavior, especially crime
