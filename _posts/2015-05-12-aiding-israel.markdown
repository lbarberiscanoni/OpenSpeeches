Senators I am up here to tell you that we need to negate this bill for really one main reason. Not because sending help to Israel will cost too much money, or that American lives aren't worth the lives of the people in the Israel Palestine conflict, but I am here to tell you that we should cut off our alliance, our financial aid, and our military aid to Israel because the land Israel lies on rightfully belongs to the Palestinians.

In order for me to get my point across I'll have to give you a brief history lesson so here we go. From 1896 all the way to 1948 there was a very steep rise in anti-Semitism in Europe. This spike pushed many European Jews out of Europe. Over 90% of these Jews moved to the then British controlled colony of Palestine. So what we have established senators is that many Jews suffering persecution in Europe moved to a British controlled Palestine which did not originally belong to the Jews or the British but was imperialized by the British and then the Jews moved there.

On with our history lesson. Because the land of Palestine contains Jerusalem it is both Holy to the Palestinians and the Jews so with the high influx of Jews into Palestine there was a tension between the two parties. Eventually the tension led to conflict. After the conflict erupted the UN was forced to get involved and they formulated a treaty. The treaty officially formed the state of Israel. Israel was 56% of the disputed land, but the thing is there were only 650 thousand Jews to the 1.3 million Palestinians so basically half the amount of Jews got most of the land while the Palestinians were stuck with a measly 44% for their 1.3 million people. Of course the Israelis agreed to this totally lopsided treaty. But the Palestinians didn't. So after the treaty was put into play Palestine attacked. During this brutal conflict 700 thousand Palestinians were turned into refugees and Israel gained 21% more land. This adds up to 77%. So now the 1.3 million Palestinians were stuck with 23% of the land while the 650 thousand Jews had 77%. So after my history lesson you all might be thinking well why are we helping them and my answer is I DON'T KNOW.

The Palestinians were robbed of their land and I say instead of helping bring peace to the region we should be supporting Palestine. Some of you may talk about the terrorist organization Hamas killing innocent people with their attacks and to that I would like to present to you this bit of information. When Israel rebuked after the Gaza missile bombardment according to the United Nations they killed 2127 people, only 616 were combatants. And for those of you who say we cannot afford to support Palestine, why don't we just redirect all the money we are dumping into Israel into Palestine. Business insider reports that since 2010 we have contributed 3 billion dollars to the Israeli military annually. That adds up to 15 billion dollars. ON THE WRONG SIDE SENATORS. So please stand with me in negation so we can give the Palestinians back what they deserve.
