Adlai Stevenson once remarked that "The tragedy of our day is the climate of fear in which we live, and fear breeds repression. Too often sinister threats to the Bill of Rights, to the freedom of the mind, are concealed under the patriotic cloak of anti-communism." Today, it's the cloak of anti-terrorism. It's because it is our unconditional commitment to due process, even in the face of danger, that makes our country great that I stand before you today urging you to NOT allow the State Department to become the judge, jury, and executioner.

Today's legislation is at its most basic level un-American. Yes, un-America! Because in America we believe in the separation of powers. Our legislative branch creates laws that the executive branch is supposed to execute (unless it's immigration reform these days), and we have one of the most sophisticated judicial systems in the world to hold the other branches accountable to our Constitution. We have this process in place, as James Madison explains in the Federalist paper #47, to "implement a system of check balances against the tyrannical use of power". Letting the Department of State to bypass this process is the first step to break down our system of government.

Today's resolution represents our failure as congressmen and congresswomen to do what we were elected to do: to defend the rights of the American people. Passing this bill is a message that we have given up on holding the government accountable and demanding justice the American way. How can it possibly be ok for us as Congress to simply say "go ahead" to an an executive branch to take illegal actions without legislative approval??? Wars on false pretenses, warrantless wiretaps, torture, rendition, and the intimidation and targeting of political organization are just a few of the things that happen and have happened the moment we as Congress gave into fear for our national security.

That's why the real problem of today's legislation is the precedence it sets. This resolution de facto justifies the executive branch to exercise its power without being checked by Congress. This resolution opens the door for the Department of State to put on the list and unilaterally kill anyone they deem "a threat", even regular Americans just like you and me.

I stand here today not to protect ISIS, but to protect the system that for centuries has protected all Americans. It takes courage to stand up for justice when a real danger like ISIS is on the horizon, but the American people need us now more then ever to be brave.
