Compulsory Voting

Senators we must negate this bill for three main reasons. 1 if we force people to vote they will just do it because they have to and won't take the proper time to educate themselves on the candidates, 2 if a person doesn't like the candidates on the roster the will be forced to vote for something they don't want, and 3 the amount of voting polls we would have to add would cost a lot of money.

My first contention, People just won't take the time to educate themselves on the candidates. Senators when my wife asks me which outfit she should wear to the party, honestly, I don't care so I just randomly pick one. I don't take the time to carefully observe the two outfits I just pick the one that catches my eye. The same applies to compulsory voting. The average nonvoter is someone who simply doesn't care. Of course if they hear there is a 500 dollar fine they will go to the voting booth, but what is stopping them from just bubbling in random candidates that they know nothing about. Passing this bill won't allow us to see the opinions of the people more clearly it will only fog our vision more. And who is to say that having the people who don't vote stay that way is a bad thing. Do we really want the opinion of someone who doesn't even take the time to research the candidates for the leaders of their country? Contrary to some peoples beliefs not all nonvoters are just too lazy to vote. Some of them are just abstentions. This leads me to my second contention.

In this congressional chamber when we vote on a bill the presiding officer asks for all in the affirmative, all in the negation, and all abstentions. This is because some of us senators don't like the outcome of either side of some bills and that is why we are given the choice to abstain. Voting should not be any different. For example let's say that the world turns upside down and Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein are having a runoff for president. I don't want to vote for either of them but with this bill I would have to. Now obviously it wouldn't be on that sort of scale but the same idea applies. If I don't agree with the ideals of either candidate I should be able to abstain.

My third contention. The amount of polls we would have to add would cost an extreme amount of capital. The huffington post reported that in 2012 only 58% of the population voted. This leaves 42% of nonvoters which adds up to about 93 million people. We have all heard our friends complain about the line at the polls so imagine if 93 million more people voted we would need more polls. Votingmachines.org reported that an average voting station costs about 4500 dollars. Because the states have control over how many voting precincts they have there are only estimates on how much the country contains. It could be from 50 thousand to 100 thousand. If they rest of the nonvoting population was forced to vote we would have to double the amount of precints which would cost roughly 225 million to 450 million.

For all these reasons we must negate senators.
