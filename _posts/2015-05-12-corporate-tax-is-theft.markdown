Decrease Corporate tax
 NEG

I will not vote for a bill that merely attempts to mask the persistent problem that is the income tax. Since the legal justification on Corporate tax is that it is an income tax I cannot vote for anything that legitimizes it. It is legalized involuntary servitude and it dispossess individuals of their earnings, regardless of its limits I cannot vote for bill that continues the problem of involuntary servitude.

This bill has one truly excellent point,
 And that is that money and resources are better used in the free market then we here in Congress can, but it is that exact principle that I urge a negation vote

Imagine if you will this is year is 1850 a senator proposed a bill to limit the amount times a slave-owner could whip his slave. Of course the bill is well intentioned, however could you vote for the bill and in doing so legitimize the abuse that is slavery.

The point of that story is to explain why I cannot approve the bill, masking a problem doesn't solve the problem. No one can deny that when you forcibly take 100% of someone's earnings that that is slavery. So at what percent is dispossessing people of their earnings is no longer slavery?

I am morally object the income tax and I urge you to do the same.

Forced taxes on your salary is involuntary servitude from which Americans are supposed to be protected by the 13th amendment.

Unfortunately in the progressive era amid other disappointing policies, cough the Federal Reserve cough, the 53rd Congress of this union passed the 16th amendment and ruled that your income is not your property, in other words the fruits of your labor are not yours to eat.

If any of you can I beseech you to explain to me how the income tax is not at least somewhat involuntary servitude. I'm proud of my voluntary servitude to the citizens of my state and I cannot in good conscious legitimize their involuntary servitude to you. If we abolished the income tax then families will have the ability to save money for college.

I ask you to think critically on the status quo, and not to make slavery merely palatable.
