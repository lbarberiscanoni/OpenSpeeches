Senators this bill needs to be affirmed for two main reasons. The government is pouring money into police departments where the money is not needed and the things the police departments are using this money for are outrageous.

NBC news reported that since 1996 the federal government has put 4.3 billion dollars into militarizing the police force. This money was allocated by the government to the local police departments because of the war on drugs. The only problem is, though I admit that drug use is prevalent throughout the country, the only place that you think you would need military grade firearms and vehicles are near the border of the United states and Mexico because that is where the drug cartels are the most active. Instead of focusing on those areas the 4.3 billion dollars has been spent elsewhere in the country. A report by business insider showed that Georgia was one of the states with the lowest amount of drug use in the country with about only 4.96% of the population using illegal drugs yet these 4.3 billion dollars are being wasted on things that I will elaborate on in my second contention.

My second contention is about the outrageous things the local police forces are spending this government funding on. As reported by NBC in Doraville Georgia, the state with the lowest amount of illegal drug use, a local police department has used their government funding to get a MILITARY GRADE TANK. Now as you all remember this money was supposed to be for the war on drugs but tell if you're seeing something I don't senators but do a bunch of stoners really need to be confronted at the end of a tank barrel. I think not. And this isn't even an isolated incident senators. As documented in the New Hampshire department of safety archives the city of Keene New Hampshire in august of 2014 applied for a military grade armored truck nicknamed the BearCat. As reported by the United States census bureau the city of Keene only has a population of about 23 thousand. Does this small town really need an armored truck to fight a war on drugs the answer is no.

So senators because of the outrageous equipment made available to the police and the amount of money being spent on cities that don't need military equipment to fight a war on drugs we must stand in the affirmation for this bill.
