Ending the Drug War AFF

John Locke considered the role of a good government to be protecting LIFE LIBERTY AND PROPERTY. Liberty uniquely stands out as the most important it is freedom that makes life meaningful and property worth pursuing.

Thus I stand favor of today's legislation because of freedom: the unalienable right of every single American to exercise their own will so long as they don't infringe on another's natural rights.

When Senator Tapp (I would pick Sarai because it is even weirder to think of her smoking weed)lights up his blount who is really suffering? In whose defense are we as the US government exercising our authority? Where is the victim that so desperately needs us? I can already feel the Negation sharpening its claws to say "Society is the victim". The problem with that position is that there is no such thing as society, to quote the former prime minister of the United Kingdom Margeret Thatcher "there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families." But there isn't society. , Their body is their own property therefor those on the affirmitive must believe the federal government has legal possession over the bodies of its constitutents and the see themselves as the victims due to the reduction in value of their property.

Futhermore when the federal government convicts non-violent drug offenders,

it kidnaps and locks someone in a prison. In his essay "on liberty" John Stuart Mill wrote that "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others." So unless the negation can demonstrate a clear victim of drug use it is uncivilized and wrong to persecute non-violent drug offenders.

I however can prove clear and obvious victims of the drug war, the national review found that about 25% of all prisoners in the United States are non-violent drug offenders, that's 500,000 people but that's just in the United States the real drug war is in Central America where NPR reports that 70,000 people have died due to the drug war since 2006 and thousands more have disappeared. And a 2013 report from the Huffington Post publicized that at any given moment there are 4000 US troops in Latin America and 4 large Naval ships. This War is costly~~( as demonstrated by senator )~~and costs lives. End this brutality, are we not more civilized than killing and imprisoning people who have not hurt anyone else.

Stand in the Affirmative today, end this brutality.
