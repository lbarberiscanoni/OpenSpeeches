ISIS kill list

NEG

"You think the only people who are people, are the people who look and think like you. But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger, you'll learn things you never knew, you never knew." So sang Pocahontas to John Smith in the Disney movie Pocahontas, despite the obvious childishness, children's movies teach lessons and this one is that we should not pass blanket judgment on a group of people us without us doing the proper investigation and going through due process.

The premise of my speech today is that we don't know the who the Department of State will put on their kill list, so before we let the State Department assume everyone is either a terrorist or an ignorant savage I urge us to have investigations and trials for the accused. Since the State Department could accuse and then kill anyone in that area and not give a single reason why.

It is unconstitutional for us to have an executive branch that carries out the powers of "judge, jury and executioner". The Legislative branch creates the law the executive branch enforces it; but this bill circumvents the judicial branch but not having a trial. This bill effectively sends our civilization back to the dark ages back to pre1215 and the signing of the Magna Carta.

~~To quote the Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu wrote in his book the Spirit of Laws "When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body there can be no liberty, because apprehensions may arise lest THE SAME monarch or senate should ENACT tyrannical laws to EXECUTE them in a tyrannical manner. Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for THE JUDGE would then be THE LEGISLATOR. Were it joined to the executive power, THE JUDGE might behave with all the violence of AN OPPRESSOR. ''~~

The French Philosopher Montesquiou advocated in his book the spirit of laws that when the legislative, executive and judicial powers are joined there is no liberty and has all the violence of an oppressor.

In Federalist paper 47 James Monroe summarized that view as simply "the separation of powers" which means each branch of government carries out a different role. If one person or one group of persons makes the laws enforces them and judges the accused, then they are guilty of tyranny but Monroe advocated checks and balances and as such the point of our government is the exact opposite of this bill.

This bill claims to go against the precedent of overreaching executive powers but its actually legitimizing it. And its tolerating tyranny.

Today's resolution represents our failure as congressmen and congresswomen to do what we were elected to do: to defend the rights of the American people. Passing this bill is a message that we have given up on holding the government accountable and demanding justice the American way

It takes courage to stand up for justice when a real danger like ISIS is on the horizon, but the American people need us now more then ever to be brave. So please vote in the negation
