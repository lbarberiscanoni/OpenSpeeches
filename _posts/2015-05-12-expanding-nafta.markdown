"Which is better for man and for society—abundance or scarcity?

This is the first line from "what is free trade"\* a book by the great french philosopher and economist Frederick Bastiat. And that is the question we face today will we vote for free trade and abundance or for scarcity and oppression by governments to control the voluntary exchange of goods and services between nations. I stand in the affirmative for abundance and for economic freedom.

The CATO institute reports in the article titled "The success of NAFTA" that "Trade among the United States, Canada, and Mexico has flourished since the passage of NAFTA, benefiting American consumers and exporters. Since 1993 trade with our NAFTA partners has increased by 44 percent. Compared to 33 percent in American trade with all other countries. America's two largest exporters, the countries for which we export goods, are first Canada and second Mexico. What we see is that the United States actually exports more goods to countries in NAFTA. And as such it only makes since to increase the amount of countries with which we have free trade, so not only do we receive more goods at cheaper prices but we also produce more as well. Moreover the Heritage Foundation found that jobs supported by exports pay 13 to 16 percent more than other U.S. jobs

But beyond statistics what does this bill mean?

Whenever I buy a product I have committed voluntary exchange, when I think the value of a product is higher than the cost I will buy that product. The producer sets the price for what they think the value is and so when we trade we each benefit we both have more than we had before. And by what right does the Government dare interfere.

Bastiat lived in a time where mercantilism, isolationism and napoleon were tearing the western world apart. Fortunately (Unlike those in the negation) we have grown and free trade and abundance now prosper throughout the world. We have the European Union and The North American Free Trade Agreement and Now I Stand in the affirmative for the Free Trade Area of the America's.
