A Bill to implement a Guest Worker Program

AFF

I stand in affirmation of this bill because of 3 primary reasons first immigration is an American Principle, second it will benefit our economy and finally why we really need to open our borders.

The statue of liberty is inscribed with a sonnet by Emma Lazarus unfortunately I do not have the skill to read it here and do it justice so I will only read a small section. "Give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."

We are a nation of immigrants who worked hard, fought for they believed in, and extended that liberty to others, we should allow anyone who is willing to come to the united states to create a new life, live that life under our laws and make a life for themselves.

Which brings me to my second point the positive effects their new lifes have on or economy. According to the Foundation of Economic Education, historically immigratns have a "positive impact on GDP per capita" and decrease the native unemployement rate.

Finally to my last point why do we really need to increase the amount of immigrants? According to NY times the majority of immigrants come from Mexico and Central America. And they are not fleeing poverty or unemployement they are fleeing violence. Robert Reich The Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley or as my fellow senator from South Carolina Senator Dai, who went their refers to it; UC Berkeley, He says in an interview said that these immigrants are refugees of a war. A war which we started called the Drug War. These refugees should have access to our United States Refugee Admissions Program. Unfortunately they do not and so anything we can do to save these peoples lives which is what the real issue is, we should pass. This bill saves lives. When we think of the drug war in the United States we think of arrests and prison but people in Central America think of death and dying. NPR reports that 70,000 people have died in the drug war since 2006 and thousands more have disappeared. And a 2013 report from the Huffington Post publicized that at any given moment there are 4000 US troops in Latin America and 4 Naval ships. Needless to say the Drug Cartels have guns and resources too.

We have been at war in that region for decades and we should pass any legislation, which helps these victims and survivors. For these reasons I implore a vote in the Affirmation.
