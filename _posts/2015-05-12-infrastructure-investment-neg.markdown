A bill to provide Investment for infrastructure

A popular story floats around groups that favor free markets. The story goes when Milton Friedman was in Asia, and he observed a canal being built. He didn't see the use of any heavy machinery. What he did see was workers with shovels. So he asked the government official who was with him, "why don't these people have heavy machinery?" the story goes the official responded, "you don't understand. This is a jobs program." Milton replied, "well, then you should take away their shovels and give them all spoons."

In my speech I will explain why we don't need to increase government spending on infrastructure and why job bills are inefficient.

The Encylopedia of Nations, which provides information on aspects of countries, reports that quote "the United States has an excellent infrastructure" and "the nationwide infrastructure is capable of supporting the needs of the economy." The only real place the bill has any merit is it as a jobs bill.

Of course we all want more employment and lower unemployement. But it should not be done by adding jobs which do not demonstrate a specific value to this nation. The goal of employment is the value that the job creates not the job itself.

In order to pay for this bill the government would have to tax other people in other places, in order to fund this bill, and those taxes would destroy jobs that create value.

Rather than the government passing a jobs bill, we should focus on having a market where jobs can grow.

The National Center for Policy Analysis, found in a study done by Mr. David Ranson whose the president and director of research at H.C. Wainwright. That "cuts in government spending release resources that the private sector could have put to work more productively. On the average, reduced government growth implies increased business growth and a brighter picture for the economy as a whole,"

His evidence was that "For the three years in which federal consumption spending fell by between 2 and 5 percentage points of GDP (the average reduction was 3.4 percent), private sector spending rose 4.2 percentage points during that and the following year.

For the two years in which federal consumption spending fell more than 5 percentage points of GDP, the average reduction was 17.9 percent; private sector spending rose 29.3 percentage points."

There is no clear evidence for the necessity of this bill and job bills are inefficient because the resources will be used more carefully in the free market because the owner has personal interest in success. Vote in the Negation to avoid waste and be more responsible representatives.
