Argentina NEG

Philosopher Bertrand Russell once said "War does not determine who is right, only who is left"

Which is I stand here today against this bill because engaging in this conflict with Argentina will bring nothing but suffering.

Were we and the U.N. to investigate the death of Alberto Nisman, and were we to find the Argentinian president Christina Fernandez is guilty of murder, what are we expecting as a consequence? At worst, Argentina would see us as an invader once again, intruding in their local politics, trying to influence their government for our own gain as we have done countless time in the past in South America. At best, today's legislation will be ineffective because the Argentinian people themselves will see us as imperialistic, and will perceive the UN investigation as a violation of their right to national sovereignty. Seriously, what are thinking is going to happen? That she just turn herself in? That her own government turn on her?

Because both of those outcomes are highly unlikely, the only realistic way to meaningfully do anything about Nisman's death is to use force. The CIA world factbook reports that Argentina has 20 million adults of military age who are fit to be conscripted, which is smaller than our own but still a large amount of people. So how many die to have justice for one man, how many deaths for the death of one. As much as we all desire justice, there is already so much death in the world and so I ask you is it actually worth it?

War wouldn't benefit anyone, it hurts our economy since it deprives our market of resources, it hurts the population not only immediately but even today we can see the effects WW2 had on the English population and WW1 had on France populations.

Vote in Negation, because justice should not be imposed by a foreign power, but it should be embraced by the local people.
