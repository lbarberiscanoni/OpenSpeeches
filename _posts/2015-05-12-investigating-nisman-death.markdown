**Nisman â€“ neg**

1. _The Argentinian investigation is still going._ This resolution states that "the Argentinian government has ruled the death a suicide and will not proceed with any further investigations". However, according to the Buenos Aires Herald of this Wednesday, prosecutor Viviana Fein will continue leading the investigation into Nisman's death and was pleased yesterday when she was confirmed in handling the probe. Furthermore, the New York Times of March 5 tells us that Fein says that "nothing allows me to categorically assert today that it was suicide or homicide" and that the investigation will continue until one or the other has proven to be the more likely option.

1. _This resolution would violate complementarity_. The International Criminal Court, the court where the case would presumably be referred to, seeing as that the case would be prosecuted by an UN investigation, is not allowed to hear or prosecute cases if individual states are "unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution", according to the Rome Statute. Since Argentina is still in the process of investigating Nisman's death, the ICC cannot prosecute or hear the case, and therefore neither can the UN.
