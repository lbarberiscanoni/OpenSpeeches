**ISIS â€“ neg**

1. _Authorising the strikes violates international law._ According to the Telegraph on September 23, 2014, the only two reasons for using force in a way that does not violate international law are for self defence or to protect international peace and security. On 14 August, the UN Security Council passed resolution 2170 deploring the terrorist acts of ISIS, and "its continued gross, systematic and widespread abuses of human rights." Acting under Chapter VII, it urged all states to protect the civilian population and to cooperate in bringing ISIS to justice. However, the key phrase, to use "all necessary means", which in UN-speak is code for use of force, is missing.

1. _We would be acting as nothing more than a rubber stamp._ If we were to pass this legislation, it does not in any way serve as a check on the executive branch's power. Instead, because we are simply going along with President Obama's plans, despite this bill claiming these actions to be "illegal", we are just being yes-men and affirming his decisions. This is not a check on his power and this does not do anything to refute this precedent the resolution claims will be in place.
