"What a cruel thing war is... to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbors." â€“Robert E Lee said that, the irony being that he is remembered for war and also being our enemy. But he explains an overarching truth. War is bad, and our support of Isreal encourages Isreal and spurns Hamas to action, I stand negation of todays in order to avoid problems in the future and will then go over the cost this bill would entail.

First, to avoid problems in the future, according to the Jerusalem post US Gen. David Petraeus said on March 16 2010 that US involvement in the Arab-Israeli conflict hurts America's ability to advance its interests in the Middle East, fomenting anti-American sentiment and limiting America's strategic partnership.

Actions have consequences and this bill will have a cause and effect. The Arab Countries that surround Israel do not like Israel, so when the US funds Israel those Arab Countries extend their dislike to us.

So this puts the United States itself in danger.

Secondly the United States already is funding Israel. According to Business Insider we give more than 3 billion dollars annually to them already. But primarily there is problem with this bill, there is no number. This bill fails to set an amount and there is no limit to the resources we are providing. For example it could be arms it could be capital it could even be troops, this bill has zero limitations. And as such we must negate because that is irresponsible of us as representatives. I cannot in good conscience write a blank check for Israel. We should promote peace and trade, in that region and not war and destruction.

So to conclude when the black hand assinated archduke ferdinnand the black hand was no doubt a terrorist organization but Germany giving Austria a blank check only escalated the issue. Same thing today a vote in the negation is responsible and in America's best interest. Thank you
