Online Sales tax

We need to affirm this bill for two main reasons. Companies like Amazon are practically stealing from states that require a sales tax, and not making online companies like amazon charge a sales tax could disrupt the economy.

In the United States almost every single state has a sales tax. This sales tax helps the state government fund all its facilities and overall keeps local governments. So you might be asking yourself how companies like Amazon can get around this tax. The answer is that in the constitution it states that if I buy something in California while I am in South Carolina the place I bought said thing from in California doesn't have to charge a sales tax because the tax in California is different. So therefore when using Amazon most of the times you are not getting something from inside your state so you don't have to pay tax. The only problem is that I don't think the people who wrote that in the constitution didn't account for the internet. Because of this it is our duty as senators to amend the constitution in the best way possible. Therefore we must affirm this bill. But this isn't the only reason,

My second contention, without the sales tax on internet sales it would and is disrupting the current market. With amazon not having any sales tax it is becoming increasingly hard for other companies to compete. If I want a leaf blower for my backyard and it costs the same at both Walmart and on Amazon I am going to buy it from amazon simply because of the few dollars I'm going to save. So pretty much all I have to go to an actual physical store for is food and when I need something very quickly. Therefore companies like Walmart and target are losing business because of a loophole Amazon has found in the system. Some of you might ask why Walmart doesn't just sell stuff online. Well they do, but unlike Amazon they can't avoid sales tax because they have locations in almost every single state in the country.

Therefore senators we must affirm this bill to help local, county, and state institutions, and we must affirm this bill because how can we call this country a country with free enterprise if the government is giving companies like Amazon an unfair advantage. Thank you and please affirm.
