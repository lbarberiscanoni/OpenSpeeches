Patent NEG

My first contention is that this bill extends the problem of our current patent laws by blaming the victims and forcing them to pay legal fees of the accused. My second is that this bill will slow the development of new technologies.

A History to go article from the Utah State Government points in 1927, a man by the name of Philo Farnsworth invented the first working electric television, in fact his statue resides in this very capitol building. Unfortunately for him a lengthy trial with the Radio Corporation of America or RCA, ended up with him on the losing side.

His Biography declares that a part of his invention was ruled to violate a patent from 1923 from Vladimir Zworykin who had since abandoned the electric TV in an attempt to build a mechanical one, and so our genius lost his invention and would spend the rest of his life in financial instability and would go on to die in debt.

The point of that story is to show how our constituents are affected by patent law, this bill exasberates the issue by forcing those potential victims to pay legal fees even after paying the price of having lost their invention.

Now I will go onto my second point which is that this bill decreases the incentive for competition. I agree with Intellectual property but I also believe in the advancement of technology.

The CATO Institute reports in a report entitiled "Bring Appellate Competition Back to Patent Law" Author Timothy Lee says that the explosion of patents is due to the legal advantages of patents; namely decreased competition rather than actual innovation.

An Article from Forbes titled "5 reasons why competition is good for business" that it leads to innovation, better customer service, shakes of complacency, better understanding of the market and Education

Innovation causes advacements in technology and Education from seeing what your competitor does well leads to more information. Both led to a better product market and potentially a better world.

In conclusion this bill could end up blaming the victims of what amounts to robbery and it decreases competition which hurts the market, vote in the Negation to prevent the further constrictions of our current patent law.
