Police Militarization

NEG

Fellow congressman in my speech I will go over the poor wording of this bill and then how unlike in Pokemon in real life badges don't grant extra rights.

As my first point this bill isn't clear over how different weapons are categorized for example: According to Police How a company designed for people to learn how to become police officers. Generally a police officer has a police pistol, a baton, a flashlight, handcuffs and maybe a tazer, while they can also have access to police shotgun and a bulletproof vest they do not generally patrol with those.

So in a scenario where a suspect has a knife what weapon can the officer use? A pistol tazer or shotgun are all greater forces than a knife. While some batons are made of metal most are not and as such the knife would cut through it rendering it useless. And so all a police officer could legally use is a flashlight. The wording of this bill would mean that unless the suspect attacked with the exact same weapon that the police officer has the cop would always be at a disadvantage

And yea affirmative speakers talk of police brutality and I agree that a lot of Police are just bad people but if a police officer was already in the mindset of hurting others this bill why would one more bill stop them.

Rather I suggest cops should face criminal charges the same way anyone else would for their actions since, as I said in my introduction, badges do not grant extra rights and so police should face investigations and trails for their illegal actions. Not let off with a mere suspension. Nor wait for the Department of Justice since as the American Civil Liberties Union reports there are cases of police brutality everyday throughout the entire country. Instead police should be investigated by the local law enforcement and if the local law enforcement refuses they should have to be considered accessories to the illegal action and the state law enforcement is next in line and any issue there is dealt with by the department of justice. That process is known as federalism. We shouldn't skip around and bring all actions to the central government. We should follow federalism.

And so I urge a negative vote because this bill is poorly worded and undermines federalism which is the principle of our government. Thank you
