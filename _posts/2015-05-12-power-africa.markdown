Somalia has problems but none of them is anarchy there are 4 governements competing over control and I believe the bill has picked the wrong one. I am going to layout a Counterplan because the suggested government is internationally considered a failure and Somaliland is a nation on the rise.

I assert that rather than giving the specified resources to Dowladda Federaalka Soomaalia instead we give them to Somaliland where the resources would be put to actually constructive use.

CNN ranks Dowladda Federaalka Soomaaliya as the number one political risk hotspot in the world. In such a country, United States funded infrastructure seems worthless due to instability. However NPR reports that"Somaliland is a pocket of stability in a chaotic region"and that Somaliland is stable enough for foreign investment including a multi-million dollar Coca-Cola plant. Google is visiting the countries 6 telecommunication companies and China is investing in the countries fishing industry.

Beyond there economic capabilities a country must be able to defend itself Navy Times calls the Somaliland Navy as the quote "most effective force in fighting Somali pirates" It is also important to recognize they are fighting because they care, the 600 strong navy has a total of one boat motor and 200,000 thousand dollars anually. And yet they are successful. The only country that I can think of that broke away formed a republic and fought against such odds successfully was our own 228 years ago. However perhaps the best representation of a government is its constitution. So to explain why to vote in the negation today and yet still support a brighter future and stability in that region. I will explain by reading a few segments of the Somaliland constitution.

The Republic of Somaliland recognises and shall act in conformity with the United Nations Charter and with international law, and shall respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

The state shall lay down the national economic policy based on the principles of free enterprise and the joint working of private property, public property, the national wealth and foreign investment so as to realise the growth of productivity, the raising of the standard of living, the creation of jobs, and, in general, the advancement of the economy of the nation.

Voting in the affirmative would support the a failed state and would in doing illegitimize a stable country.

May I remind you we needed French help in the American Revolution. For the same principal we should help Somaliland because of all the reasons stated above and to do so please vote in the negation.
