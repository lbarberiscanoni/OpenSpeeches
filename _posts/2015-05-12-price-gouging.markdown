A Bill to outlaw price gouging

NEG

This bill is an insult to property rights and economics. And in my speech I will explain to you why for these two reasons you should vote in the negation.

First of all a storeowner owns the resources in his store and what he does is with them is up to him, the passage of this bill would deprive storeowners of their ownership. And so if implemented this bill would according to section 5 remove all property rights from Americans. And according to the 5th amendment that can only happen after due process and so there are only 2 ways to implement this bill either this bill supersedes the bill of rights or it is effectively convicting all store owners of owning stores and therefore seizing their property because if you regulate someone's property what you are really doing is controlling it.

And to my second contention, what price the resources are sold is a voluntary agreement between the owner and the consumer, if the consumer thinks the price is too high he wont buy the product reversely the store-owner wont sell a product for what he believes is too low.

When an abnormal disruption upsets the balance of supply and demand by skyrocketing demand while plummeting supply the value of the remaining supply rises. The affirmative stands up here and says how this is disproportionally unfair to poorer Americans but their proposal fails when you take into account what happens if prices were forced to be stable.

Immediately preceding and following disasters there would be a rush for the resources this disadvantages those who cannot compete. The elderly and the sick would go without despite potentially being willing to pay more because they cannot rush to the stores to keep up with the healthier, fitter competition. This is just as unethical,

So even if the bill passes, there are still people who will be disadvantaged based on their situation.

In conclusion, Vote in the negation of todays resolution because the only possible result is the eventual tyranny of this Congress since we will be able to control the property of Americans and it is not only wrong in the economic sense but immoral to decide who gets what, not based off of who is willing to pay more but first come only served.
