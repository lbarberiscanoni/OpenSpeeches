At first I looked at this legislation with abhorrence; but then I noticed in line 9 that the year can be served in either the military, civil service or Americorps. Both Affirmative and negation speakers have stood up and talked a lot about the military and even the bill talks about world tensions escalating and the necessity of a strong military. I am against war ;However I stand in Affirmation in todays resolution and I will layout how this bill will actively led to more experience and brighter futures for our youth and as a result less war

Americorps is a great opportunity for young Americans to grow as individuals. For those us you who are not familiar with Americorps it is a service where Americans participate in volunteering, and they work for the benefit of others. Molly Latham from the Univerisity of Nevada reports that teenagers volunteer 2.4 billion hours annually which is worth 34.3 billion dollars to the us economy.

This report goes on to state that teens affiliated with volunteering programs such as Americorp are quote "50% less likely to abuse alcohol, cigarettes, become pregnant, or engage other destructive behavior".

Stop looking at this bill like it's a sentence to go to war and instead look at it through the lenses of community service, such as planting trees and building houses for the homeless. And as another year of public education, teenagers would learn behavior like respect, leadership, and hard work, They would make friends and connections which will help them later in life.

This resolution really could and should be seen as public education extending to public service. It provides our young americans with a baseline of experience, effectively raising not only their own value but the nations.

And of course when you combine, job experience with less likelihood of destructive behavior and increased GDP, we lower the poverty rate. When we increase our GDP, it helps the International market increasing international trade as John Stuart Mill said (a citizen) now sees in (other country's) wealth and progress a direct source of wealth and progress to their own country. It is commerce which is rapidly rendering war obsolete", trade links countries together and reinforces personal interests in the markets of other countries thus lowering the incentive for war.

Vote for the Affirmative because this bill will help our nation and, in contrast to the name, promote peace.
