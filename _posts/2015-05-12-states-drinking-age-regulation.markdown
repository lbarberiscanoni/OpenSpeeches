Drinking Age NEG

John Locke considered the role of a good government to be protecting LIFE LIBERTY AND PROPERTY. Liberty uniquely stands out as the most important it is freedom that makes life meaningful and property worth pursuing.

Thus I stand negation of today's legislation because of liberty: the unalienable right of every single American to exercise their own will so long as they don't infringe on another's natural rights. And as such I believe in a counterplan for abolishing the drinking age altogether.

When Senator Dai was 17 and took her first tequila shot who was really suffering? In whose defense are we as the US government exercising our authority? Has she been caught and send to jail, would she be here today? (Probably yes: she would have pulled a George W. Bush and said she found Christ and no longer drinks.). All the things that we think of as underage alcohol related crimes against others are already crimes in and of themselves. Drinking is a choice like any other, and by refusing to acknowledge this basic fact, we only make the situation worse. The President of John Hopkins University recently remarked on the Washignton Post that " the legal drinking age encourages binge drinking on Campus because underage drinkers try to make the most out of the few opportunities they get to consume alcohol"

What's worse is the HOW the federal government enforces drinking age laws: by abusing its legal power and its violent force. In his essay "on liberty" John Stuart Mill wrote that "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others." Do you want to know the real victim is in all of this? ABC News reports that just yesterday March 19 2015 that at a University of Virginia student had his head repeatedly slammed against the pavement by police officers charring him with purchasing alcohol with a fake ID. That's what the drinking age has become: an excuse for the government to abuse it's power over our lives.

So unless the negation can demonstrate a clear victim of drinking, it is uncivilized and it is WRONG to persecute underage alcohol consumers. Stand in the Negation and end the brutality and uncivilized behavior of persecuting someone who hasn't hurt someone.
