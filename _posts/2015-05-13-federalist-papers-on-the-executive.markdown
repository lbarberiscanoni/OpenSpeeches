The Federalists on The Executive

Alexander Hamilton, Federalist 70

"There is an idea, which is not without its advocates, that a vigorous executive is inconsistent with the genius of the republican government"

"Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government"

"Decision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch will generally characterize the proceeding of one man in a much more eminent degree than the proceeding of any greater number; and in proportion as the number is increased, these qualities will be diminished."

"…how often the great interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity, to the conceit, and to the obstinacy of individuals, who have credit enough to make their passions and their caprices interesting to mankind."

"In the legislature, promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a benefit"

"It often becomes impossible, amidst mutual accusations, to determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures, ought really to fall"

"…first, the restrains of public opinion…lose their efficacy, as well on account…second, the opportunity of discovering with facility and clearness the misconduct of the person they trust…"

"…it is far more safe there should be a single object for the jealousy and watchfulness of the people"

"When power, therefore, is placed in the hands of so small a number of men as to admit of their interests and views being easily combined in a common enterprise, by an artful leader, it becomes more liable to abuse, and more dangerous when abused, that if it be lodged in the hands of one man, who, from the very circumstance of his being alone, will be more narrowly watched and more readily suspected, and who cannot unite so great a mass of influenced as when he is associated with others."

Alexander Hamilton, Federalist 72

"…a man will be interested in whatever he possesses, in proportion to the firmness or precariousness of the tenure by which he holds it.."

"if the case should only be that he might lay it down…his wishes conspiring with his fears, would tend still more powerfully to corrupt his integrity, or debase his fortitude."

"The republican principle demands that the deliberate sense of the community should govern the conduct of those to whom they entrust the management of their affairs; but it does not require an unqualified complaisance to every sudden breeze of passion, or to every transient impulse which the people may receive from the arts of men, who flatter their prejudices to betray their interests."

"It is one thing to be subordinate to the laws, and another to be dependent on the legislative body."

"…and in addition to this propensity, where the alteration has been the result of public choice, the person substituted is warranted in supposing that the dismission of his predecessor has proceeded from a dislike to his measures; and that the less he resembles him, the more he will recommend himself to the favor of his constituents."

"This exclusion, whether temporary or perpetual, would have nearly the same effects, and these effects would be for the most part rather pernicious than salutary."

"…the negative merit of not doing harm, instead of the positive merit of doing good."

"By necessitating a change of men, in the first office in the nation, it would necessitate a mutability of measures."

Alexander Hamilton, Federalist 73

"…a power over a man's support is a power over his will."
