The Federalists on The Senate

James Madison, Federalist 62

"...instead of indulging a fruitless anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue, to contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may qualify the sacrifice."

"It doubles the security to the people by requiring the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient."

"The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions to be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions."

"But continual change even of good measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence and every prospect of success"

"…it forfeits the respect and confidence of other nations, and all the advantages connected with national character."

James Madison, Federalist 63

"…in an assembly so durably invested with public trust that the pride and consequence of its members may be sensibly incorporated with the reputation and prosperity of the community."

"Nor is it possible for the people to estimate the share of influence which their annual assemblies may respectively have on events resulting from the mixed transactions of several years"

"As the cool and deliberate sense of the community ought, in all governments, and actually will, in all free governments, ultimately prevail over the views of its rulers."
