As the great Martin Luther King once said "Injustice anywhere undermines justice everywhere". I support this bill because America is the land of the free.

Right now, rights are not equally respected in our nation: and this is because of our drug and prostitution laws. On one hand, we have the federal government making its own policies, and on the other we have the states exercising their 10th amendment rights. The problem however, is that the right to consume substances and to enter professions is a basic right that the constitution affords to all people, regardless of the state in which they reside. In Washington and Colorado, Americans freely exercise their right to blunt that joint. In Nevada, women and men freely chose to enter into the oldest profession: and I am not talking about politics. The problem is that it's not consistent throughout our nation.

We have a constitutional obligation to uphold the rights of our citizens equally. The 14 amendment reads "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." This means that a state cannot deny rights to American citizens that the constitution affords. Last time we let the states decide which rights they wanted to uphold, black Americans remained horribly oppressed for decades in the South.

Whether you are INSERT SENATOR from INSERT STATE, or INSERT SENATOR from OTHER STATE, your rights should be the same. This bill should have come earlier, just like the Civil Rights Act, but it's never too late to uphold Justice.
