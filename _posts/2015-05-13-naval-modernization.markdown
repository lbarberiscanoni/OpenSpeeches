Naval Modernization NEG

**Art. 2 Sec. 2** _"President = commander in Chief" therefore he has foreign policy power_

In **Little v. Barreme** the SC confirmed that _the executive branch has the power to deploy and rearrange naval forces_

Sect.1 A "shall establish additional naval bases in Japan and Australia"

Justice Jackson explains why in **Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer**"When the President acts pursuant of an expressed or implied congressional power it has the widest latitude of judicial interpretation"

**Goldwater v. Carter** _"All the Senate can do in matters of FP is pass resolutions to suggest as opposed to legislate"_
