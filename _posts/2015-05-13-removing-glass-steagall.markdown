Leads to under-utilized capital

**Greg Mankiw** , HBR on Mar. 2012_"US businesses and the value of the US dollar are contingent upon trade. Bank capital is critical to loans to businesses and the strength of US securities"_

**Susan Lee** writing the CSR Magazine, Aug. 2006_"Glass-Steagall would undermine our financial competitiveness because international actors are not regulated. Capital was much lower until 1989 because it was lacking massively in investment banks"_

Transparency is the real problem

**Robert Shiller** , Econ. Prof. @ Yale on "Financial Markets"_"transparency is critical to open markets because it promotes efficiency and prevents toxic assets from being traded which is the base of financial crises"_
