Solar Power
 Neg

The Great economist Milton Friedman once remarked "underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief and freedom itself". This bill lacks the conviction that solar energy is able to compete in the free market.

Which is my one of my two contentions; that this bill directly goes against the market economy and instead favors a central plan. My second is the amount of money already given in subsidies to the energy industry is already large and this bill is drops in the ocean comparatively.

In an article by Forbes titled "Government Subsidies" the Author Paul Nahi says "Lousy companies that are limping along on subsidies will slow the growth of the industry. If a product is well designed and meets the needs of the consumer, it will find success in a market economy". And that's the whole point of our economy so the best product and company succeed. But when the government gives subsidies out, it defenestrates that point after all whats the point of our free market economy since, if this bill passes, the government is effectively picking and choosing winners and losers in the market.

This brings me to my second point, the amount of capital the government uses to pick winners and losers. In a report called Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications from January 2013 The international monetary fund found that the United States government gives upwards 1.9 trillion dollars every year in energy subsidies. Which means the 25 billion dollars is roughly 1.3 % of the current amount given.

If we stop subsidizing the energy industry we would save money and this gives us more options. What we should do is give this money back to our constituents, after all we are here to represent them and who is better suited to represent them financially than the can. They can through the free market express their beliefs by endorsing the products the freely choose to purchase.

So to conclude this bill undermines the free market and we already give an unimaginably high amount towards energy subsidies. Vote in the negation for liberty and stopping the presidence of raising the amount given in aubsidies.
