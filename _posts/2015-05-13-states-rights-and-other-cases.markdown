**The Tillman Act of 1907** (34 Stat. 864) (January 26, 1907) was the first legislation in the United States prohibiting monetary contribution to national political campaigns by corporations.

_ **Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co.** _, 129 S. Ct. 2252 (2009), is a case in which the [United States Supreme Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) held that the Due Process clause of the [Fourteenth Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) requires a judge to recuse himself not only when actual bias has been demonstrated or when the judge has an economic interest in the outcome of the case, but also when "extreme facts" create a "probability of bias.". THEREFORE PACS CANNOT DONATE TO A JUDGE BECAUSE IT'S AN AMOUTH OF MONEY THAT RAISES A SUBSTANTIAL FEAR OF CORRUPTION

_ **Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida** _, 517 U.S. 44 (1996)[1], was a [United States Supreme Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) case which held that [Article One of the U.S. Constitution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_U.S._Constitution) did not give the [United States Congress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress) the power to [abrogate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrogation_doctrine) the [sovereign immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity) of the [states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state) that is further protected under the [Eleventh Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Amendment_to_the_U.S._Constitution).

_ **Katzenbach v. Morgan** _, [384 U.S. 641](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_citation) (1966)[1], was a [United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) [Supreme Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) [case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases) regarding the power of Congress, pursuant to Section 5 of the [Fourteenth Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), to enact laws which enforce and interpret provisions of the Constitution. Congress may enact laws stemming from its 14th Amendment enforcement power that increase the rights of citizens beyond what the judiciary has recognized.

In 1988, the holding in [_ **South Dakota v. Dole** _](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_v._Dole)[15] reaffirmed the authority of Congress to attach conditional strings to the receipt of federal funds by state or municipal governments. In addition to the requirement that spending be for the general welfare, however, the Court devised more scrutinous criteria for determining the constitutionality of the conditions imposed:

- First, there can be no surprises; that is, the conditions for receipt must be stated clearly and the beneficiary must be aware of those conditions and their consequences.
- Second, the conditions imposed must be related to the spending in question.
- Last, the incentive must not be so significant as to turn cooperation into coercion.

_ **Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company** _, 157 [U.S.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports) [429](https://supreme.justia.com/us/157/429/case.html) (1895), _aff'd on reh'g_, 158 [U.S.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports) [601](https://supreme.justia.com/us/158/601/case.html) (1895), with a ruling of 5â€“4, was a landmark case in which the [Supreme Court of the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) ruled that the unapportioned [income taxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_taxes) on [interest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest), [dividends](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividends) and [rents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rents) imposed by the Income Tax Act of 1894 were, in effect, [direct taxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_tax), and were unconstitutional because they violated the provision that direct taxes be apportioned.
