**Taylor Seybolt,** from the University of Pittsburgh, analyzed 17 military interventions in six countries in the last 20 years and states that _"Humanitarian interventions tend to prolong conflicts by supplying resources to local fighting forces that don't conclusively end the conflict and by incentivizing dependency on humanitarian aid as an excuse for not taking political action to stop the war"_

**Mark Katz** , on a Foreign Policy article of Sept 12th_"The Syrian conflict has led to a spillover of refugees running for their lives. The rebels have also expanded their military presence in Turkey and Saudi Arabia"_

**Michael Brush** , prof. @ Columbia Univesrity, NYT Sep. 3rd_"OPEC doesn't want instability tos spread bc that wound undermine investment in oil. Stability is critical to the oil price bc if the oil price increases then costs across the board would skyrocket as a consequence"_
