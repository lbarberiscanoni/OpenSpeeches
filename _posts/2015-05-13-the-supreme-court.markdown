The SC is 3rd branch of gov IE highest judicial authority

Cases heard if there is a challenge to a fed

Cerciari is the oral hearing granted to about 90 cases

SC cases can lump cases together and try to hear important legal issues

There are 3 trends

From 1789 to 1840 most cases were issues of Federalism IE interaction btw state and fed gov

1840-1937 most cases dealt with economic isssues

1937-now most cases deal with civil liberties

Judiciliazation of political issues IE SC makes groundbreaking decisions

Roe v Wade and Brown v Board

Political and judicial natures must be mutually exclusive

The idea is that Congo is mob ruled so SC key to minority

Gay Marriage

Scalia asks whether SC landmark ruling necessary with young ppl changing views

10th Amdt argument bc Policy power (regulating health, safety, morality) is a state issue

Standing

Demonstration that one has the right to be heard in the court

SC vs Fed court justices

Life Tenure

SC shouldn't be a political institution so life tenure checks

SC often does things that ppl don't like such as Brown v Board or Obamacare

The rights of people shouldn't be tied to political conflict

Jurisdiction

Federal case (gov as party, foreing gov, corporate case dealing with interstate)

9 circuits (9th is super liberal)

DC circuit court triggers SC normally

Opinions are normally not every shocking

They take EVERY case
