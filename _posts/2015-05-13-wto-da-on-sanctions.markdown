**Robert Lawrence** ,professor of I-Trade and Investment @ Harvard on CFR Report

_The WTO is the only effective mechanism for international dispute settlement, and it thus prohibits the use of unilateral sanctions against WTO members unless it was approved by the WTO in the first place."_

**John Ikenberry** , prof. of Politics @ Harvard explains on FA

"_the WTO is the critical multi-lateral framework that stabilizes international finance and prevents trade wars. However, it functions based on its members willingness to abide by specific principles that moderate economic relations among countries."_
