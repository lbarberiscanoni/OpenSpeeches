James Buchan, Scottish novelist and historian, once said, "A century ago, petroleum- what we call oil, was just an obscure commodity; today it is almost as vital to human existence as water." I strongly urge you to affirm this bill for the following reasons:

First, by exporting Crude Oil, it would help the U.S. economy. According to an article from Renewing America, on July 2013, Exporting crude oil has become economically attractive to the energy industry. Crude oil exports have grown from next to nothing in 2007 to around one hundred thousand barrels per day in March 2013, all of which went to Canada. Also according to the same article, Oil production has grown more in the United States over the past five years than anywhere else in the world, even as domestic oil consumption has declined. With these changes has come a widening gap among the types of oil that U.S. fields produce, the types that U.S. refiners need, the products that U.S. consumers want, and the infrastructure in place to transport the oil. Allowing companies to export U.S. crude oil as the market dictates would help solve this mismatch.

Second, it wouldn't hurt the American People. Some anti- oil politicians say "Exporting American oil might be good for Big Oil's bottom line, but it would harm American families and businesses, and erode our progress towards energy independence that enhances our national security." But they are wrong. In an Energy Information Administration, or also known as the EIA, report and other studies show quite clearly that free-market-driven U.S. crude oil exports could help consumers by lowering gasoline prices, creating well-paying jobs, and boosting the U.S. economy. The new EIA report found crude oil exports would not raise gasoline prices because they track the global cost of Brent oil produced in Europe. Therefore, if U.S. crude oil exports led to a slight increase in oil prices, U.S. consumers would not experience higher prices at the pump. According to an article from The Hill on November 10, 2014, in a separate study, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) discovered that allowing exports could actually decrease consumer fuel prices. By selling U.S crude on the global market, more oil would be available worldwide, which could push prices down, create a new incentive for additional U.S. oil production, increase the size of the U.S. economy, lead to more jobs, and reduce the trade deficit.

So for the following reasons, 1. It would help the U.S. economy 2. It would not hurt the American People. I strongly urge you to affirm this bill. Thank You.
