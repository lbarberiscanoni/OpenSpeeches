In the past year there was a movement called the ALS ice bucket challenge, it was great, money was raised for a disease but there is a key difference between that and this bill, the ALS ice bucket challenge was a voluntary action, taxes are not.

Today I will go over two contentions first we shouldn't force our citizens to pay for stem cell research and secondly Embryonic stem cells aren't effective

My first point is that when the United States government gives money out like this we are decreasing the power the people have in our economy I think the economist Ludwig von Mises said it best "In the market economy the consumers are supreme. Consumers determine, by their buying or abstention from buying, what should be produced, by whom and how, of what quality and in what quantity." In this bill the government would pick which companies the money would be given to, rather than private citizens and consumers.

Its important to remember that there is no ban on private funding and private sponsorship. If we decreased taxes by 600 million dollars a year that money would stay in the economy and if the American people chose whether or not they want to give this money without the need to force everyone else to.

My second contention is that embryonic stem cells are not effective. The Heritage organization reports in an article titled "Federal Stem Cell Research: What Taxpayers Should Know" that quote "No currently approved treatments have been obtained using embryonic stem cells. There are no human trials-despite all the hype and all the media. After 20 years of research, embryonic stem cells haven't been used to treat People because the cells are unproven and unsafe. They tend to produce tumors, cause transplant rejection, and form the wrong kinds of cells."

I don't know about you but I wouldn't want a liver growing in my knee. And as such Embryonic Stem Cells are not effective. According to the National Institute of Health the Federal Government gave 4.598 trillion dollars between 2002 and 2013 to stem cell research and there is still no applicable use for embryonic stem cells.

To conclude I urge a negative vote since it is unethical to force people to pay for things and this bill also gives money to a failed enterprise that has no evidence of a benefit in the future.
