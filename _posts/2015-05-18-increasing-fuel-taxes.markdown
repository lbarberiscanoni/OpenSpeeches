Intro:

South Carolina has pretty terrible roads. According to Popular Mechanics, I-26 is one of the deadliest roads in the country. Many people are asking why South Carolina hasn't fixed these crumbling roads. It's because of our low fuel taxes. Today I will affirm this bill for the following three reasons: Firstly, it will fix our crumbling roads and bridges, and secondly it is the perfect time to instate the bill.

Point 1:

The Highway Trust fund, the fund used to build national roads and bridges has been steadily declining since 2012 according to the DOT. This is because we are using a 1993 national fuel tax. It was made for a 1993 road budget. Back when less people were driving fuel-efficient vehicles and 8.1 million less vehicles in general. This is the main reason why our 21% of American roads are in poor condition (USA Today) and 67,419 US bridges are rated structurally deficient (American Society of Civil Engineers). And the reason 42% of urban highways remain congested. AND why America received a D for roads and C+ for bridges from the American Society of Civil Engineers. The most devastating fact is a better-funded Highway Trust fund could have saved 13 lives when the I-35W Bridge collapsed.

Point 2:

In addition, now is the perfect time to instate a higher fuel tax. According to CNN and most people who drive, gas is the lowest it has been since 2009. This means it will be easier for the public to adjust than it would be if gas were higher up. Also, since it is indexed to inflation, unlike our current tax, they only have to adjust once. On top of that, people WANT higher fuel taxes, because they support the building and maintenance of roads and bridges. According to a poll of 15,000 Americans conducted by MTI, 67% supported an increase in fuel tax to improve maintenance. According to another poll conducted by the AAA, 55% of Americans are willing to pay more at the pump to fund roads and bridges.

Conclusion:

So America is in dire need of this money, it's the perfect time to instate the law, and Americans are in support of it, it's clear this bill is in America's best interest. And I think it is our job as legislators to act in America's best interest. I thank the chair.
