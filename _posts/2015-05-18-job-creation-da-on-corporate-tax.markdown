Intro:

Senators, when I was in high school, everyone seemed to think that I ran a Kwik-E-Mart and worked for AT&T technical support. This stereotype of Indians answering customer service phones emerged through the outsourcing of many businesses to India to avoid corporate tax. The people who told me these stereotypes were selfish and didn't think about how I felt. In the same way, we are being selfish and not thinking about the people of the United States. So, I must negate this bill for the following reason: lowering the corporate tax rate hurts American jobs.

Point 1: It hurts job creation

The idea that lowering corporate tax leads to less jobs for our constituents can be illustrated by many real world examples. Firstly, in 2004, we passed a tax "holiday" that allowed companies to bring back profits earned abroad at a 5% income tax rate instead of the top 35% rate. According to the Wall Street Journal, the fifteen companies that benefited most from the tax holiday subsequently cut more than 20,000 net jobs. Lowering the corporate tax rate also increases the deficit, which hurts job creation. This is because lowering the federal corporate tax rate reduces also the amount of money the US government receives in tax revenue, thus reducing federal government programs, investments, and job-creating opportunities. The increasing of the deficit due to decreasing corporate tax can be evidenced by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which reduced the top marginal rate from 46% to 34%, and as a direct result, the federal deficit increased from $149.7 billion to $255 billion from 1993-2006 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In addition, The US economy added 15 million jobs in the five years immediately following a large federal corporate income tax increase in 2004. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 added three new corporate tax brackets and increased the income tax rates for corporations making income over $10 million. According to the Wall Street Journal, The US economy added more than 15 million jobs and grew at an average annual rate of 3.8% in the five years after the legislation was passed.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, it is clear to see that lowering the corporate tax detrimentally impacts jobs in the United States. And it is our job as senators to think about our constituents, and this bill negatively impacts them. This is why I urge you to negate this bill.
