Intro:

The movie "Frozen" taught us with it's annoyingly catchy song "Let it Go" to take our troubles and let them go. This bill proposes to do the same and let go of the reimbursements that Obamacare consumers may owe the U.S. Government. However, this is not the best plan of action. So, I must negate this bill for the following reasons: The U.S. will lose money and the U.S. will lose investors.

Point 1: U.S. will lose money

While disregarding reimbursements may make Obamacare available to more people, the U.S. will be wasting money. Through this bill, the U.S. is essentially giving out taxpayer's money every time they make a mistake, and the money is not being used to fund transportation, education, things that it was meant to do. This frivolous waste of money can make the United States look bad in the global community. Which leads me to my next point.

Point 2: U.S. will lose investors

The United States is a role model in the international community. Imagine if you saw your parents do something you knew was irresponsible for the first time, like drink and drive. Most people wouldn't trust their parents with making decisions like that anymore. The same applies to this bill. If the international community sees that the U.S. Government isn't responsible with taxpayer's dollars, they will lose the trust other countries have in the U.S. that we will be responsible with the money that they invest. Thus, we will lose the number of investments in general.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the passing of this bill will lead to the U.S. losing money and losing stature in the global community, which will will lead to less global investments. This is why we must negate this bill.
