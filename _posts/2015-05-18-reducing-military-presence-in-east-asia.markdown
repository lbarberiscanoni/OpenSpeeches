Intro:

Imagine you possess the 15th-largest economy in the world. You have world-class cars and consumer goods, glittering streets and a lifestyle as good as any in the industrialized world.

Now, imagine a hostile country one third as wealthy as Ethiopia is threatening you. _Ethiopia._

In order to protect yourself from this economic juggernaut, you require the presence of nearly 30,000 American troops, the overpowering might of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and an American general to take charge in case this mighty opponent attack. Sounds laughable right? Well, Welcome to South Korea. Seoul can easily defend itself. In fact, most of East Asia can. Today I must affirm the bill to reduce military presence in East Asia for the following three reasons: It's unneeded, expensive, and strains relationships.

Point 1:

During World War II and the Cold War, East Asian may have required our presence, but the tables have turned. The economy of East Asia is one of the most successful regional economies of the world. It is home of some of the world's largest economies: China, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea. Yet we still occupy countries like Japan and South Korea, both of which have militaries in the top 10 in the world. We could be using the troops and money expended in more imminent threats such as the Middle East. Which leads me to my next point.

Point 2:

According to CBS, America spent $1.1 billion in non-personnel costs in South Korea, and $200 million in Japan last year. And these countries are paying a hefty price to keep American troops as well. According to Foreign Affairs, Japan pays the largest amount of all countries with American troops, $4 BILLION, and South Korea paying $290 million, respectively. All of this while Japan faces a financial crisis. This brings into question how Japan could possibly support large military occupation in America. They don't

Point 3:

Many Americans see the presence of U.S. troops in Japan as a gracious favor meant to support Japan's security. Most Japanese, while fond of the alliance with the United States, would like to see fewer U.S. troops on their soil. A May 1996 opinion poll in Asahi Shimbun 67 percent favored a reduction in the number of U.S. military bases. Charles Armstrong, a Columbia University Korean Studies professor, says,"There are many Koreans who would like to see an American troop reduction, and argue this is a provocation to the North, that it creates a provocation that is unnecessary, and that it's an infringement on Korean sovereignty."

Conclusion:

Simply put, the military occupation of is unnecessary, pricey, and is angering citizens. This is why we must pass this bill. I thank the chair.
