Introduction:

"Fight fire with fire". It's an old, overused phrase that just isn't true. It doesn't apply to anyone, especially FIREFIGHTERS. And in light of recent school shootings, such as Sandy Hook, people are saying we should let teachers fight GUNFIRE with MORE gunfire. Today, I'll explain why I negate this bill for the following two reasons: Firstly, it's dangerous for students AND teachers, and secondly, it's too much responsibility for these appointed officers.

Point 1:

The Utah Department of Public Safety reports that in the state, it is legal to carry a firearm inside public schools. Because of this law, there have already been many accidents. NBC reports that a Utah teacher's gun accidentally discharged and hit her leg, and another case where a teacher's gun accidentally discharged and hit a toilet, and shrapnel struck her lower leg. This proves these aren't just isolated incidents, and it's not hard to imagine a situation where a child gets shot. Not to mention that TWO teachers have already been shot. This leads me to my next point.

Point 2

Teachers are meant to be teaching, not defending our schools. It takes years for SWAT and police officers to be trained to handle these intense situations, and teachers simply don't have the time, and they may not be capable of it. Just imagine if a TEACHER had to make the decision to shoot a HUMAN BEING, not to mention if a student was caught in the crossfire. Such a situation happened in New York, as New York Times reports, when a POLICE OFFICER accidentally shot a hostage. If a FULLY TRAINED POLICE OFFECER can make this mistake, then surely minimally trained teachers can. And if they weren't able to open the drawer where the gun was kept, or not able to take the shot, they would be considered a culpable nondefender, or someone who doesn't do their job. This makes them another target for finger-pointing, excuse-making, lawsuits, or worse.

Conclusion

The dangers caused to student and staff forces me to negate this bill. I believe we are rushing to action as a result of the devastation of these school shootings. We should consider giving teachers non-lethal weapons such as Tasers and tightening up security at the door to avoid the many dangers presented in this speech. I thank the chair.
