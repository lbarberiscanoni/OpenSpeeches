This bill must be negated for three main reasons. There are regulations that are in place that restrain drones, it is hypocritical, and Drones are the future of our society.

Drones, contrary to popular belief are not violation of citizen's fourth amendment rights. The wall street journal reported that the FAA in November of 2014 put forth very restrictive regulations on drone usage. Regulations include usage only within daylight hours, a 400 foot height restriction, and the drone must be in sight of the person who is piloting it. The regulations group all drones under 55 pounds into one group to prevent people with smaller drones from ducking the rules. Also all those who would like to fly unmanned drones would have to get an aviation license which requires hour of flight in a manned aircraft.

Second, This bill is hypocritical. This bill calls for the ban of unmanned aircrafts over American soil but does nothing to the drones that we use overseas. Those who are in the affirmation would have us ban drones because they "violate our privacy" but would allow drones overseas let alone violate privacy but kill people. In my opinion it should be the other way around. We should be focusing on the ethics of using drones overseas rather than quarreling about the commercial use of drones. Stanford University states that drones are not a precise and surgical tool to eliminate threat but a blunt weapon that causes many civilian casualties.

Third, Drones are the future of the commercial industry. Commercial industries have plans for using drones in industries like film, web product distribution, sports, farming, and construction. In these industries for example farming drones could help improve production rates enormously. If these drones were put into use farms could regulate crops on a much larger rate. Construction could be made safer by instead of sending a human being who could possibly be injured sending an unmanned drone.
