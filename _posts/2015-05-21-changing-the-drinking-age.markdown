There are 3 reasons this bill needs to be negated, One it violates the supreme court case South Dakota v. Dole, violates New York v. United States and isn't actually in conflict with the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984.

My first contention, this bill violates the Supreme Court case of South Dakota v. Dole. This Supreme Court case is what determined that National Minimum Drinking Age Act was constitutional because it gave a financial incentive and didn't force the states into anything. This piece of legislation doesn't provide any economic incentive and therefore is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court case South Dakota v. Dole and just outright forces states to abide by this federal policy which is why it is also in conflict with another Supreme Court case.

My second contention, New York v. United states. This was a supreme court case that determined forcing states into federal policy through harsh punishment, coercion, or just outright forcing them is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court case itself was about forcing states to assume liability for radioactive waste they create in their borders if they didn't comply with the The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act. The Supreme Court ruled that forcing states to comply with Federal policy through harsh punishment is unconstitutional. This bill just outright forces states to comply without economic incentive and then implies there will be a punishment for not complying but never actually specifies the actual punishment. Therefore this bill is in conflict with two Supreme Court cases and cannot be passed.

My third contention, This bill doesn't actually make the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 void. The NMDAA for short doesn't actually force states to comply with the law so technically have whatever drinking age they want. If we affirm this bill the minimum will be 18 but since the NMDAA doesn't outlaw going under 21 the two aren't in conflict therefore this piece of legislation effectively changes nothing. Because if states decide to go under 21 they will be punished by the NMDAA with a 10 % highway funding deduction so most states will just stay at the age of 21 for drinking. My counterplan is too negate this bill and abolish the NMDAA altogether and allow states to choose the drinking age for themselves. Although the NMDAA was declared constitutional by South Dakota v. Dole that doesn't mean it should be in place. I personally believe that states should be able to choose their drinking age without any repercussions at all.

So because this bill violates two Supreme Court cases and does absolutely nothing because it fails to make the NMDAA void we must negate.
