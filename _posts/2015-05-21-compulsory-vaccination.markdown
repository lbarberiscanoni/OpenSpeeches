Senators we must affirm this bill for really one main reason which is the safety of our children, but I would also like to talk about how this bill would be put into place and shut down any doubts about it early.

For my first contention senators I would like to talk about principle. Not vaccinating children is putting other children at danger. Some children in the public school system cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons and the kids that can be vaccinated but don't because of "personal beliefs" put these children in danger. An example, npr.org wrote an article on Carl Krawitt and his son Rhett. Rhett has had leukemia since he was two years old and is now 6. Rhett has gone through countless bouts of chemotherapy and the doctors have finally told the Krawitts that Rhett has entered remission. Because of the state of Rhett's immunes system he can't handle taking the immunizations that are required to go to public school so he has to go without them. But unfortunately he isn't the only one there is also the other 6.25 % of children without vaccines because of their parent's personal beliefs. These children put kids like Rhett and themselves in danger. Mrs. Krawitt said it best the school prevents all peanut products to enter the building for the safety of the children but it will allow children without immunizations to put the same children in danger.

Some of you might be thinking well that's all well and good but is there really any danger because I haven't given any examples of measles outbreaks. Well that's what this second contention is for. CNN reported that in Disneyland this year a Philippi no tourist entered the park with the measles virus. This tourist caused a small outbreak of 30 US citizens which could have been worse but of course most people had been vaccinated as a child. This wasn't the case for 383 people in 2014 in Ohio. This is the same strand of the measles virus that has affected the Philippines and has infected over 53,000 people and killed 110. This virus isn't just a rash it can be very dangerous and needs to be prevented with the vaccinations of our children.

My third contention. The implementation of this bill would be safe and wouldn't be a waste of money. The CDC has known to be a branch of the government that likes to spend funds in a ……stupid sort of way. They buy playgrounds for their workers and do unnecessary experiments with no usable results but the NCIRD which is the branch of the CDC that would implement this bill is different. They are almost an entirely different branch of government that is only under the CDC because it deals with diseases.

For all these reasons senators please affirm.
