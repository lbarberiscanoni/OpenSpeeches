_High corporate tax rates are a major cause of outsourcing._ Becky Yerak of the Chicago Tribune tells us that the United States is tied for the second highest top-bracket federal corporate income tax rate in the world behind Antigua & Barbuda and Congo (and is the highest in the OECD), and it has a higher "effective" corporate tax rate (27.6%) than 164 out of 183 other countries. [2] These high tax rates force American companies to relocate their employees overseas. For example, Aon, a company with $11.28 billion in 2011 revenue that moved its headquarters from Chicago to London in 2012, said the move would reduce its tax rate by five percentage points, increase its profits by about $100 million annually, and allow them to expand by hiring more employees.

_Outsourcing can actually hurt companies._ According to Panos Mourdoukoutas of Forbes Magazine, outsourcing leads to the fragmentation and disintegration of the supply chain, inviting new competitors into the industry, and undermining pricing power and profitability. Outsourcing of manufacturing, for instance, is feasible only if it can be separated from other supply chain activities: product development, branding, marketing, distribution, and after sales services. The same is true when it comes to outsourcing marketing or distribution and so on. This means that as more and more activities are outsourced, the supply chain turns from a single integrated process performed within the boundaries of traditional corporations to a fragmented and disintegrated process, a collection of separate and disjointed activities, performed across several independent subcontractors. And although such a fragmentation and disintegration of the value chain offers corporations a number of well publicized advantages, it has an unintended consequence: It makes entry of new competitors to the industry easier, intensifying competition, shortening product cycles, and squeezing return on invested capital.
