This bill needs to be affirmed because the cost is more than the good that comes out of both the DEA and the Controlled substance act and the DEA has made deals with some of the most powerful drug cartels.

My first contention, This bill costs us way too much money. Drugwar.org reported that 1.5 million people were arrested for drug related crimes in 2012 and 82% of those people were merely arrested on minor possession charges. That's 1.5 million people that have to be processed by the police and processing costs money. That cost is on top of the 15 billion dollars the government gave to the War on Drugs and State governments spent an additional 25 billion dollars.(drugsense.org) Despite achievements the DEA has made the cost is to great and the DEA accomplishments of the DEA were from agreements that they made with one of the largest drug cartels in Mexico.

My second contention, the DEA has made deals with the most powerful cartel in Mexico called the Sinaloa. In January 2014 Business insider reported that between 2000 and 2012 DEA agents have met with representatives of Sinaloa over 50 times. This cartel has illegally smuggled about 200 tons of cocaine between 1990 and 2008. The leader of the Cartel known as El Chapo is known by many as the most powerful drug lord in the world. He is responsible for 82% of the drugs found in the Chicago area and has a presence in cities all across the United States. The DEA made agreements with Sinaloa to get information on their rivals but it isn't worth it to make a deal with the devil to catch a few bad guys.

My third contention, This bill isn't legalizing drugs it is only giving the states the right to choose whether or not to legalize them. This is not different to what is going on now. Colorado, Washington, and California have legalized Marijuana even though it is on the controlled substance list. We make decisions in this country based on the constitution and the constitution gives states the rights not stated within the constitution we all know how it works therefore the legalization of drugs should be a state decision.

Senators we are repeating our old mistakes. The prohibition in the 1900's increased crime rates and overall was a bad decision and that is why we repealed it. The same thing is happening with the War on Drugs so please senators stand with me and affirm.
