_This bill violates federalism._ The legislation that many say sets the national drinking age, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, does two things – sets a target purchase and public possession age of 21 and penalises states who do not adhere to this "target" age by reducing their highway funds. Notably, this act _does not_ mandate a federal drinking age – as a matter of fact, it doesn't even actually mandate any kind of drinking age. This is left up to the states to decide if they want a drinking age at all and what exemptions or restrictions can also be placed. The legislation in front of us explicitly forces a drinking age upon the states, which violates states' rights.

_This bill does not allow for exemptions._ Current state laws allow for the consumption of alcohol for religious purposes. Furthermore, some states allow the consumption of alcohol by underage drinkers if they are supervised – Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, and Georgia allow underage drinking in private non-alcohol selling premises with parental consent. Because this bill does not define "drinking age" and does not provide any exceptions nor ways to handle exceptions, it is much less viable than the law already in place. If anything, the act should be either rewritten or amended.

_This bill will do nothing._ The key problem with this bill is that it does not actually conflict with the NMDAA. The NMDAA only sets a target purchase and public possession age, not a consumption or "drinking" age. Because of this, there is nothing in the bill that actually conflicts with the NMDAA – Section 1 says that the national minimum drinking and purchasing age will be reduced, but this doesn't actually exist. Therefore, the NMDAA will not be repealed, so states who reduce their drinking age to 18 like the bill suggests will have some of their highway fund penalised, so obviously they will choose to keep it at 21.
