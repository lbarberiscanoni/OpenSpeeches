Senators we must negate this bill because it is addressing only a small portion of the actual problem at hand. It says that it will decriminalize the euthanasia of patients with terminal illnesses but what about the people who want to die regardless of the state of their health. I have one main contention for the negation of this bill and that is all people's right to die.

I agree with this bills principle it simply needs to be extended to more aspects of the issue. This bill allows all people who have a terminal illness the right to commit suicide. But what about the people who don't have terminal illnesses. There are many people who suffer from depression and want to take their own lives but this bill does nothing to help those people. That is why this bill must be negated because all United States citizens deserve to do what they choose with their life whether that be to live or die. In the Declaration of Independence some of our unalienable rights are stated like the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This means you have the right to live but if you choose to forfeit that right it is your own decision and no one should be able to stop you from doing that. For example all United States citizens have the right to bear arms but that doesn't mean you have to own a gun.

Some of you in the negation may want to make the argument that the impacts on these peoples families isn't fair to them but it isn't fair to the people suffering from depression every day of their lives. Now a lot of you in the affirmation will or have made the argument that these people need to stop suffering and need a way out. Well the same argument could be made for these people without terminal diseases. They suffer all day too just in a different way. Dr. John Grohol classifies depression as a mental disorder. A mental disorder that causes constant hopelessness and despair. Suicidal Awareness Voices of Education.org says that people don't try to kill themselves as a cry for help or to gain sympathy but they commit suicide to end the constant suffering they are in.

Senators we must negate this bill because it isn't providing the appropriate rights to all of our constituents it is only giving these rights to people with terminal illnesses. Thank you and please negate.
