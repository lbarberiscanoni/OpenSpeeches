Argentina, home of Lionel Messi, Ginobli, and a very suspicious government that needs to be investigated because we can't allow a suspect to conduct their own investigation, it would be promoting human rights across the world, and Argentina gives consent within the Rome Statute for foreign countries to investigate international cases within their own country.

My first contention, why should we believe the verdict of a country that is the suspect of the case itself. Alberto Nisman was on the trail of the Argentinian government and was one of the first investigators to not be corrupt and I believe that is why the Argentinian government had him killed. This investigation has been fishy from the beginning Jewish Virtual Library reports that in 1996 engineers came up with a new theory that instead of their being a car bomb outside the building that a Jewish employee had set the bomb inside the building. This theory blatantly ignored all the evidence blatantly supported the theory of an Islamic car bomb and instead tried to shift the blame to others. This is despite the fact that the Islamic Jihad had claimed the attack as theirs. In the United States when someone is suspected of murder we don't allow them to conduct their own investigation so how is this situation any different.

My second contention, the affirmation of this bill would be promoting human rights and the separation of powers across the world. The United States heavily supports both of these ideas and what better way to promote them across the world then to intervene by supporting the creation of an investigation. We would be promoting the separation of powers by not allowing the Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez to trample over the judicial branch by covering up evidence. We would also be promoting human rights through help prosecute the real killer of Alberto Nisman and by trying to bring conspiracy to light.

My third contention, Argentina has already consented for us to conduct this investigation through their signing of the Rome Statute. The Rome statute which has been signed by both Argentina and the U.S. have signed allows governments to investigate four crimes without any statute of limitations. This four crimes are genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression, and war crimes. The murder of Alberto Nisman falls under crime against humanity. The Rome Statute also states that this Statute is in place to investigate crimes in which the country is unable or unwilling. Since Argentina isn't willing to conduct a fair investigation I think the Rome Statute definitely applies to this situation.

So because we would be uncovering the conspiracy around the death of Alberto Nisman, and would be doing it legally through the Rome Statute please affirm.
