Senators we must negate this bill because Cuba hasn't met the requirements put forth by Kennedy during the cold war, There is virtually no private sector in Cuba, and every time the United States has tried to loosen restraints Cuba has reacted aggressively.

My first contention, Cuba simply is not meeting the requirements of a government the United States would support. Act 3447 signed in 1962 by President Kennedy enacted the embargo that this bill wishes to abolish. It was strengthened by the Cuban Democracy Act , and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. Both of these acts laid out requirements for the embargo to be terminated and Cuba has not completed any of these requirements. Cuba must legalize all political activity, release all political prisoners, commit to free and fair elections in the transition to representative democracy, grant freedom to the press, respect internationally recognized human rights, and allow labor unions. Regardless of the requirements Cuba is still a dictator ship, is still an oppressive government, and between 2011- 2012 according to Cubanet.org the Cuban government detained over 11 thousand people for political reasons.

My second contention, The private sector in Cuba is nonexistent. Brookings.edu reports that 90% of the economy in Cuba is state owned. This means that only 10% of the trade benefits that could be had from the lift of this embargo would go directly to the Cuban government and not help the people at all. The whole point of the embargo in the first place was to help the plight of the Cuban people but without Cuba meeting the requirements of the 1992 and 96 acts the people continue to struggle. In Cuba foreign companies operating there have to hire worker through the state and wages are converted into local currency and devalued at a rate of 24 to 1. This means if you make a 500 dollar paycheck in Cuba you get 21 dollars. A quote from a local Cuban sums it up quite nicely, "In Cuba, it's a great myth that we live off the state. In fact, it's the state that lives off of us."

My third contention, every time we have tried to lift the embargo Cuba has been very aggressive. L.A. times reports in 1977 President Carter tried to open an embassy in Havana and Cuba responded by sending 125 thousand emigrants to the United States that included criminals and the ill. Also in 2009 when Obama eased on visitation privileges Castro responded by arresting an American Aid worker.

Because they haven't met the requirements, have no private sector, and have responded aggressively multiple times to attempts to ease restrictions we must negate

Thank you senators.
