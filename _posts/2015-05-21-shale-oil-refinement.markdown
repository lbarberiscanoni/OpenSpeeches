_Our refineries are ill-equipped to process "light" oil_. Much of the oil that we produce comes in the lighter, or "sweet" form. The Council on Foreign Relations tells us in July 2013 that much of the country's rapidly growing production of light crude oil, including lease condensates (i.e., ultra-light oil), comes from either areas where refiners are not interested in or able to process it, given that many U.S. refineries are configured to run lower-quality crude oil, or in parts of the country with inadequate transportation infrastructure. With few viable domestic buyers, producers are forced to choose between leaving oil in the ground and pumping it at depressed prices. These artificially low prices slow additional U.S. crude oil production. Were we to begin exporting crude oil, we would see an increase of several billion dollars per year in exports. Furthermore, "light" oil actually comes at a premium on the global market.

_Lifting the ban will increase our development of shale oil_. According to the Aspen Institute, The current price for light oil in the United States makes the development of some shale plays less economic. Once producers are free to export crude oil to markets abroad where it is more highly valued, the incentive to further develop these resources will be significantly increased. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, 2013, the United States possesses 567 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas. At the 2012 rate of U.S. gas consumption, this represents enough supply for 22 years of use. In 2011, 34 % of all U.S. natural gas produced was shale gas, and this could rise to 50 % of U.S. total natural gas production in 2040, as projected in the EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2013.
