The use of the death penalty comes from the old Biblical adage "an eye for an eye". However, a life for a life does not solve the problem. After all we as Americans have always favored a different Biblical saying which was made famous by John Winthrop "A city upon a Hill" We are to be a just Nation, an example for the rest of the world. In my speech I will have 2 contentions the former that the Death Penalty leaves no room for error and the latter that Capital Punishment is both immoral and wasteful

So first The death penalty doesn't leave room for error. When someone is executed there is no way to go back, you cannot undo an execution. Time reports on April 28 2014 that 4% of all capital punishment sentences in the United States is a wrongful conviction. In everyday life 4% sounds like a low statistic but is it not true that it is better 10, 20 or 30 guilty men go free than 1 innocent man is put to death?

On to my second point

~~(In agreement with senator â€¦)~~ An Associated press article from March 7 2009 is more expensive in fact according to Donald McCartin, a former California law expert but not only is it more expenisive it is equally more immoral. The American Civil Liberties Union tells us on April 9, 2007 that capital punishment is "immoral in principle, and unfair and discriminatory in practice [...] No one deserves to die. When the government metes out vengeance disguised as justice, it becomes complicit with killers in devaluing human life and human dignity. In civilized society, we reject the principle of literally doing to criminals what they do to their victims: The penalty for rape cannot be rape, or for arson, the burning down of the arsonist's house. We should not, therefore, punish the murderer with death... Capital punishment is a barbaric remnant of uncivilized society." Because the death penalty is morally wrong, ultimately, if we wish to uphold justice, we cannot allow anyone to send someone to their deaths, nor can we be complicit in their deaths in any way.

In conclusion, as a just Nation the United States should abolish capital punishment.

A nation that wishes to promote justice, which I hope the United States is, is morally obligated to do away with its wasteful and barbaric practices.
