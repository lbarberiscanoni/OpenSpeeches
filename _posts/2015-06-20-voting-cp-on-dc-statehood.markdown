I will outline a counterplan, so that rather than grant statehood to the District, we would return to DC residents the right to vote in Maryland's congressional election and I have two contentions why this would be better, it has a historical backing and it is the simpliest way to enfranchise congressional voting rights to DC residents.

Firstly from the creation of Washington DC in 1790 to the passage of the Organic act of 1801 residents of DC were able to vote in Virginia and Maryland's congressional depending on which side of the potomic they lived on, obviously south of the river voted in Virginia's and north of the river voted in Maryland's but since the Virginian part of DC was retroceded in 1846, the remaining DC is formerly Maryland's, and as such would vote in Maryland's elections. So we can look back on our history to come up with a solution to this problem and see that there is a historical precedent for these residents to vote in Maryland.

Which brings me to my second point, why it is the easiest way to enfranchise DC residents. As I mentioned in my first point the Organic act of 1801, not the creation of DC, disenfranchised the district's residents. The Organic Act of 1801 was a simple congressional legislative bill and as such we could refranchise these residents with a bill to repeal the Organic act of 1801 rather than the baggage of new statehood. Statehood is a complicated procedure which would take years to both hold a referendum to establish that the residents want to be a state, write a state constitution, vote on the state constitution and then we as a congress affirm their constitution.
