John Locke considered the role of a good government to be protecting LIFE LIBERTY AND PROPERTY. That liberty includes the right to free speech, by the logic of this bill anything we find annoying we can do away with, child beauty pagaents, twilight, we can at the very least remove repetitive techno music from the radio. Despite how much better the world sounds without those things, life is better when we have liberty, when we can do what we want so long as we don't infringe upon the rights of others.

Which brings me to my one and only contention, we must free the people to do what will so long as they don't hurt another's life liberty or property and taking away their rights is both immoral and unconstitutional.

In his essay "on liberty" 19th century British political philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote that "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others." So unless the affirmative can demonstrate a clear victim of from these advertisements it is uncivilized and wrong to persecute pharmaceutical companies.

For those on the Affirmative who will say that corporations do not have constitutional right to free speech since corporations are an entity and not a person. The supreme court decided in 2010 in the court case Citizens United v. FEC decided that the first amendment prohibited the government from restricting political expenditures and donations by companies. On that principle the refusing the right of these companies to advertise is an unconstitutional overreach of legislative power. And an overreach of legislative power is a dangerous presidence in the future. When we decide that we can restrict constitutional rights, where does our destruction of these rights end

People have a right to decide what is best for them and so I contend that losing rights is worse. Liberty is what makes life worth living so I'd rather the risk of people self medicating than the erosion of basic rights, because news flash **Liberty is Risky** and if youre a willing to take those risks to preserve the rights of all americans negate todays legislation.

So in conclusion in order to maintain constitutional rights, avoid instituting oppressive speech police and avoid a presidence of overreaching legislative authority stand in the Negation today
