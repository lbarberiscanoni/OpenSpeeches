In the Disney movie Pocahontas, Pocahontas sings to John Smith "You think the only people who are people, are the people who look and think like you. But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger, you'll learn things you never knew you never knew." And that resonates here today, section 2 subsection b means we would be bombing oil refineries and undoubtedly there would be casualties and since we haven't declared war on ISIS we would need to have trials for those who would be killed.

The premise of my speech today is that we don't know the who we would be killing, so before we let the Military and the head of the military, the president, assume everyone else is (a Criminal and/or terrorist), I urge us to have investigations and trials for those we are depriving of life.

It is unconstitutional for us to have an military that carries out the powers of "judge, jury and executioner". The Legislative branch creates the law the executive branch enforces it; but this bill circumvents the judicial branch but not having a trial. This bill effectively sends our civilization back to the dark ages back to pre1215 and the signing of the Magna Carta.

To quote the Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu wrote in his book the Spirit of Laws "When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body there can be no liberty, because apprehensions may arise lest THE SAME monarch or senate should ENACT tyrannical laws to EXECUTE them in a tyrannical manner. Were the power of judging joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control, for THE JUDGE would then be THE LEGISLATOR. Were it joined to the executive power, THE JUDGE might behave with all the violence of AN OPPRESSOR. ''

The French Philosopher Montesquiou advocated in his book the spirit of laws that when the legislative, executive and judicial powers are joined there is no liberty and has all the violence of an oppressor.

In Federalist paper 47 James Monroe summarized that view as simply "the separation of powers" which means each branch of government carries out a different role. If one person or one group of persons makes the laws enforces them and judges the accused, then they are guilty of tyranny but Monroe advocated checks and balances and as such the point of our government is the exact opposite of this bill.

This idea behind this bill is to stop an oppressive power from expanding there power. And its tolerating tyranny.

The accused might not be citizens but the principle of the 4th amendment is undoubtedly undermined if not wholly defenestrated when a suspect is seized of their life without a trial. But even if the amendment only ensures Americans rights this bill would still potentially allow the State Department to kill an American if they so chose.

Vote in he negation to uphold Pocahontas, sorry I mean humanity, decency and our laws
