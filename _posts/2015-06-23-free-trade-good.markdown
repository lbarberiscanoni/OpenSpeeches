"Which is better for man and for societyâ€”abundance or scarcity?

This is the first line from "what is free trade"\* a book by the great french philosopher and economist Frederick Bastiat. And that is the question we face today will we vote for free trade and abundance or for scarcity and oppression by governments to control the voluntary exchange of goods and services between nations. I stand in the affirmative for one reason Free trade is the best way for the United States to build a stronger economy.

To explain the benefits of increasing the free trade between nations I will use NAFTA as a benchmark, the CATO institute reports in the article titled "The success of NAFTA" that "Trade among the United States, Canada, and Mexico has flourished since the passage of NAFTA, benefiting American consumers and exporters. Since 1993 trade with our NAFTA partners has increased by 44 percent. Compared to 33 percent in American trade with all other countries. America's two largest exporters, the countries for which we export goods, are first Canada and second Mexico. What we see is that the United States actually exports more goods to countries in NAFTA. And as such it only makes since to increase the amount of countries with which we have free trade, so not only do we receive more goods at cheaper prices but we also produce more as well. Leading to stronger markets between nations.. Since NAFTA has benefited North America why not expand these benefits across the pacific.

Opponents of Free Trade Agreements claim it hurts jobs and damages the economy, that view is plainly wrong for example as Ana Eires reported from The Heritage Foundation U.S. textile industry has disappeared over these last few years and my homestateSouth Carolina was one of the states most affected by the shutdown of textile factories. South Carolinians, however, did not become permanently unemployed, because other industries moved to the state to take advantage of our trained labor force.

BMW is now working with Clemson University's automotive research to train engineers to sustain BMW's growth. IBM and Microsoft each contributed to this project with the idea of creating high-paying jobs tied to knowledge. Through this project, BMW "invested $2.5 billion at the plant, and now employs 4,700 people ~~, with most production workers making $24 per hour."~~~~ 1~~

BMW's investment illustrates the process of adjustment in an economically open society. In order to remain competitive and benefit from the economic evolution, South Carolina's workers trained themselves to seize the higher-paid job opportunities. The adjustment brought better-paying jobs and, with them, the possibility of raising the living standard **of all those involved** in the process of change.

So to conclude most clearly, Free trade agreements help our economy and that is why we should support this legislation.
