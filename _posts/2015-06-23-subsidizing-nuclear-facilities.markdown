As the great economist Milton Friedman remarked "underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief and freedom itself"

I stand for freedom and liberty whenever possible and I believe that the free market will solve this issue better than we here as a central planning committee can. My two contantions are that we should encourage a free market and not try to sway it one way or the other and secondly

This bill in practice would do nothing, it only calls for an encouragement of construction as such I will speak for the encouragement of the free market. The market is not the result of a central planning committee, its an on going almost organic thing it's the billions of voluntary exchanges that happen everyday. It's result of Everyone deciding what to buy and what not to buy what to trade and what not to. The Market is human action and as such when you regulate the market you are regulating the freedom of the American people and the freedom of the Nuclear Power Companies.

Which brings my to my second point. Nuclear Energy companies should do what is best, which is not necassarilly what congress recommends

This quote on quote recommendation to build nuclear facilities would switch the resources of companies from development to construction and that's a bad thing. All current Nuclear facilities use fission, this bill would have us construct more fission facilities instead of the current goal of the Nuclear Energy companies of developing a fusion reactor.

The University of California reports the fusion is 10 times more powerful than fission. If this bill passes and our recommendation is heeded we would be actively going against the current market and hurting the future of energy. Fusion technology is not far fetched after all there was a time when fission was considered to unstable. The company Lochhead Martin promises a working fusion reactor in the year 2017. This bill would be more technologically appropriate in the 1970s than today.

In summation rather than trying to manipulate or restrict or encourage the market, the market like the American people should be free. We have a choice, to vote in the affirmative and encourage the building of nuclear plants, which to me sounds like an extremely passive soviet plan or to vote in the negation if you believe in the free market and the right of Americans and American businesses to choose what is best for them.
