"We're here to serve you, when in fact we're serving ourselves. Our need to stay in power eclipses our duty to govern. That ends tonight." These words were spoken by Kevin Spacey in his hit show House of Cards. What his character meant was that politicians are too concerned with campaigning and getting reelected, so they end up not making actual change in our country. However unrealistic the show may be, politicians focusing on their own careers rather than their constituents is something many real politicians are guilty of. We must affirm this resolution to create congressional term limits so that we can get rid of career congressmen and make sure we have an actual representative democracy.

When congressmen serve for a long period of time, they become very distant from their constituents. It creates a gaping chasm between politicians and constituents. It's hard to have a representative democracy when the people in power do not know how to represent us. One of our founding fathers, the Rhode Island representative and senator Roger Sherman said that "Representatives ought to return home and mix with the people. By remaining at the seat of government, they would acquire the habits of the place, which might differ from those of their constituents."

Having "career congressmen" ruins the whole point of a representative democracy. As political scientist Mark P. Petracca of the University of California, Irvine, has written, "Whereas representative government aspires to maintain a proximity of sympathy and interests between representative and represented, professionalism creates authority, autonomy, and hierarchy, distancing the expert from the client." Thomas Jefferson urged the inclusion of term limits "to prevent every danger which might arise to American freedom by continuing too long in office the members of the Continental Congress." And according to a 2013 Gallup poll, 75% of Americans say they would vote in favor of term limits. As a representative democracy, one which has been struggling to actually be representative, it should be our duty to respect our constituents' wishes, especially when it comes to congressmen, which they already vote for.

Anyone who has seen House of Cards knows that it is not a good model to go off of if you're a politician. There are too many congressmen right now who have accidentally made themselves look like characters in it, by not representing the American people and by being politicians simply for the power. And it is because of people like that, representatives, that we must affirm this bill.
Many people in our country believe that imposing term limits on congressmen could help fix many of the issues that plague congress. However, congressional term limits have already been imposed on many states, states which have made no progress as far as fixing these issues. It was thought that using term limits would bring in new lawmakers that were more representative of the people's will, and that it would also encourage more minorities to become congressmen. We must negate this resolution to amend the constitution, because neither of these things has happened, and because even if they did, it wouldn't necessarily help.

First, we have the idea that new lawmaker's would be more representative of the people's will. But what does it take to be a congressman? Well, we congressmen typically have previous political experience, but a new senator or representative definitely is not as prepared as someone who has been at it for a while. People hoped that this would lessen the power of lobbyists in Washington. However,new congressmen often have to get even more involved with lobbyists than seasoned congressmen. US News and World Report has said that in states where term limits are in place, special interest groups have reported that they now work harder to "educate" less knowledgeable senators

People also hoped that these new lawmakers would be minorities. By making sure the current white male majority didn't get to stay in their positions, it would open the door for people who were underrepresented. After term limits were put in place in certain states, the number of female representatives did grow, yes. However, it grew at the same rate all over the country, even in places where there were no term limits. The term limits seemed to have no effect. There hasn't even been a change in the representation of racial minorities, either. Existing term limits haven't accomplished any of what they were supposed to.

But even if the goals had been achieved, and we discovered that term limits did encourage fresh faces to become a larger part of our government, the flaw is in the fact that we need seasoned congressmen. New representatives and senators tend to be much more partisan. One could even call them stubborn. But congressmen who have held their positions for a long time get to know one another. They can explore other sides of issues and can use this to make compromises that are needed to get laws passed. The bottom line is that one cannot argue with experience.

My point is that we cannot impose term limits on congress because the goals that the affirmative is trying to achieve cannot be achieved with this amendment. But besides that, we need congressmen who know what they're doing, and for that, representatives, we must negate.
