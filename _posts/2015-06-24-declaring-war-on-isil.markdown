The United States has been threatened by ISIL for too long. It started with them going through the Middle East and taking over land there, and many Americans thought it wasn't our problem. After the beheadings, the people were finally awakened. Now, ISIL has threatened to attack us on our home soil. We must affirm this bill and declare war on ISIS so that they know we stand behind the president and that we are united against them.

Right now, president Obama has authorized airstrikes against ISIL. He has been allowed to do this because he isn't sending actual troops to combat ISIL. If we declare war, then more thorough methods can be used to eliminate the threat of ISIL. Even the airstrikes can be improved. A Navy F-18 pilot told Fox News that he often flew around targets for up to an hour before striking, because he constantly had to wait for clearance. Senator John McCain even complained recently that 75 percent of pilots have to return without attacking due to these delays on higher levels. The pilot said "We have been applying air power like a rain shower or a drizzle -- for it to be effective, it needs to be applied like a thunderstorm." For us to have the necessary amount of force, we need to officially be at war with them.

Another reason why we need to declare war, however, is because then everyone involved in the decision has to be held accountable. Congress as a whole won't be able to say afterwards that it was against going to war, because we will have been on record affirming it. There is more of a pressure to see it through to the end, not only to protect the region from ISIL, but because no one will be able to say they weren't a part of the decision to go to war. Lately Congress has gotten more and more filled with representatives who don't agree with President Obama's policies. This is fine, we are a democracy. However, it results in less progress within our own government. Showing that we can unite to stop an organization that poses a serious threat to our country could show unity in our government, if only for this one decision. It will make us seem like a more organized threat in the war on ISIL.

We need to be able to unite to stop ISIL. They cause so much devastation and destruction everywhere they go, and I find it terrible that many Americans haven't cared enough to take care of it. We have to affirm this bill, to access stronger ways of combating them, and to show that the US is united against one enemy. Thank you.
