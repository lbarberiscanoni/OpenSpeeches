The only two countries in the world that haven't banned prescription drug ads are The United States and New Zealand. I would say this is because we are the two best countries, but that would imply that we have a chance of getting second place. Even worse, second place to New Zealand. What really makes us the best is our constitution. The constitution is why I must negate this bill, because it is in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, according to the legal precedents set forth in two major Supreme Court cases.

First, there was Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, in 1976. Virginia had a statute which prohibited pharmacists from advertising prescription drug prices. The Supreme Court determined that this was against the First Amendment, which guarantees the right to free speech. Their holding was that "States cannot limit consumer access to information about prescription drug prices." This essentially meant that not only did the pharmacists have the right to talk about prescription drugs, but that consumers had the right to know about prescription drugs. This case was extremely important in establishing the freedom of commercial speech, which led to the next major case.

In 1980, the Supreme Court decided against restrictions on electric utility advertising. This happened in the case Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission. The court said that placing restrictions on commercial speech was a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The 14th states that the US can't deprive citizens of life, liberty, or property; also, that they are afforded 1st amendment rights. This was based on a previous case, First National Bank of Boston v. Belloti, which decided that "the Due Process Clause gives free speech and other First Amendment liberties to corporate entities." They decided that a ban was more than was necessary to regulate these ads and that there must be a "reasonable fit" between the government's ends and the means to achieving those ends. This means that at best there can be regulation, not an outright ban.

Therefore, since the federal government is banning the free speech of corporations, it's doing something far worse: It's infringing upon the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. In Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government cannot ban commercial speech because it would be a clear violation of the First amendment. This is exactly what is happening with today's bill because the federal government is simply banning the free speech of corporations when they have already been guaranteed their rights.
