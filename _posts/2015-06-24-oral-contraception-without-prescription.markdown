We must affirm this bill to make oral contraception available without a prescription, because it will help cut down on unplanned pregnancies, but besides that, it also will not have the negative health effects suggested by the opposition.

First, making contraception over the counter will make it more available, which will help many women for several reasons. Many women who are underinsured or don't have insurance wouldn't normally be able to afford contraception, because it requires a trip to the gynecologist and everything else. If it's over the counter, it eliminates the need for a doctor's visit, and would cause the companies to compete to make their products cheaper. But besides that, prescriptions are harder to attain for people living in poverty, or for those that don't speak English. But why does it matter? Why can't women just put up with a trip to the doctor? It's because making it simpler and cheaper will cut down on the number of unplanned pregnancies. 50% of all pregnancies in the US are unplanned, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This number, however, hasn't changed in 20 years. Making contraception over-the-counter would communicate to both women and men that they need to have safe sex. I mean, morning after pills, which are just higher-dose versions of normal birth control, are already over-the-counter, if you're over 18.

There are some concerns in the opposition that making contraception available without prescription would be unsafe. They believe this is because of the side effects, but also because they think there would be fewer trips to the doctor. However, neither of these things would be issues. For one, there would obviously be labels on the boxes. All drugs have labels, and it's left up to the consumer to decide if the drug is right for them. Besides that, there are special guidelines for over-the-counter drugs. The FDA would conduct more tests to make them safer before making them more available. There are already harmful drugs available without prescriptions, such as Tylenol, which you can overdose on, and Benadryl, which can be addictive. And as for the doctor issue, Mexico already has over-the-counter contraception. They haven't even seen a decrease in the number of women who go for Pap smear tests and breast examinations.

Oral contraception is no more deadly than many other drugs available without prescriptions. Because it promotes safety, stops unplanned pregnancies, and would not have serious health effects, we must affirm this bill.
