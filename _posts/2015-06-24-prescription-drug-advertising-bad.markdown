The United States and New Zealand are the only two countries in the world that allow direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads. The rest of the world has decided against them, as said by the World Health Organization, which unanimously recommended prohibiting DTC advertising. Why would they have such a strong opinion on this? It's because these ads often misinform patients, and in turn cause harms and drug abuse.

A CMI study in April 2013 found that 63% of physicians believe that DTC ads misinform patients, and 74% say they overemphasize the benefits. They leave out important information. They can make people think that normal attributes, such as things that come with aging, are medical conditions that require medications to fix. 94% of oncologists surveyed by CMI said that patients had asked them for specific prescriptions, and 43% had felt pressured to prescribe them. This in turn can lead to a lot of over medication. There are about 25 times more children in the US who take ADHD meds than there are in the UK, which doesn't allow DTC prescription drug ads. An estimated one in ten boys in the US is on ADHD meds. 81% of the doctors surveyed earlier even said that the ads cause overutilization. This can lead to even more problems when the drug isn't completely safe.

A lot of misinformation comes from things that the drug companies don't even know. Even though drugs are tested thoroughly by the FDA before being made available, there can still be extremely detrimental effects. I see commercials all the time, telling people to call to join a class action lawsuit if their loved ones have died because of a prescription drug they took. There can always be effects that only become apparent a long time after use. One example is Vioxx, an arthritis medication that was the suspected cause of death of 4,540 people between January 1, 1999, and June 30, 2005. The FDA doesn't have to approve commercials before they air, like many people think they do. The side effects in the ads are often spoken very fast or written very small, so people often miss the most vital part of the advertisement.

These DTC prescription drug ads attempt to mislead people in order to hide how much danger there is, which becomes a real problem when they become so readily available. For this, senators, we must affirm this bill.
