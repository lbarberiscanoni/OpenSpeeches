Let's be honest. Tax exemptions for churches are not a right. They are a privilege. And no matter how many churches responsibly use their exemptions, many churches waste money on a large scale that the government would be able to use. We must affirm this resolution and lift the tax exemption for churches because there are too many instances of "churches" wasting the money that we let them keep, and this is because of the vague nature of the exemptions.

Look at the Church of Scientology. Now, it wouldn't be right of me to attack anyone who believes in Scientology, but the way that the church itself operates is definitely a problem. TIME magazine described it as a "thriving cult of greed and power" and "a hugely profitable global racket". The New York Times estimated that they had saved tens of millions of dollars in unpaid taxes. Now, this is a system that makes each member donate thousands and thousands of dollars just to progress through the teachings, and uses the money for things like Super Bowl ads, which cost millions of dollars. Another example is Pastor Creflo Dollar. He asked for donations to buy what what Bloomberg calls "the Holy Grail" of luxury private jets. He wanted this $65 million Gulfstream G50 in order to spread God's word. Creflo Dollar Ministries recently announced that they will buy it. They were able to raise $65 million, tax free, that instead of being used to feed the hungry or actually spread God's word, was used for a private jet to let this pastor fly comfortably wherever he wishes. It makes sense for taxpayers to pay for something that does charitable work, like a non profit organization. However, all churches aren't as generous with their money as others, so it isn't fair for them to be exempt.

But what constitutes a church? The IRS defines it as having a distinct legal existence and religious history,a recognized creed and form of worship,established places of worship, a regular congregation and regular religious services, and an organization of ordained ministers. However, there have been exceptions, such as the Young Life organization, which doesn't have its own building, but does meet regularly in several locations. A religious organization does not need to fulfill all of the criteria. This means that the IRS often accepts both genuine and fraudulent faiths. Fraudulent in this case, however, just means that the organization just wants to make money. What may have started out as a real faith just became greedy and lost its original purpose. The IRS can't tell when a faith is fraudulent, because it's not their place to discriminate between faiths.

The select group of organizations that abuse the system are unfortunately the reason why we can't trust any of them, and why they should pay taxes like anyone else.
