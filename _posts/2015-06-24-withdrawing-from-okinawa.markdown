The island of Okinawa was the only place in Japan that experienced ground battles in World War II. In the Battle of Okinawa, about 200,000 people died. You can see why having 32 military bases there would serve as an unwelcome reminder for the bloodshed that happened there. Especially when these bases occupy 20% of Okinawa. We must stand in affirmation of this resolution because the bases have a lasting impact on the Okinawan economy and environment, which harms our relationship with Japan.

An article published by the Japan Times on May 18 talks about how productive the land can be. A mall complex was recently built on top of a former US Military golf course, and is generating a lot of revenue for the island, which has one of the worst economies in Japan. The people of Okinawa have realized that these bases are just an impediment to economic growth. The former governor assembled an expert panel to submit a report on the island's economic prospects. They found that an average land lot of 1 square kilometer generates ¥1.6 billion, while that land occupied by military bases generates ¥900 million.

The current governor also has issues with the bases, though. According to The Guardian, in March, he ordered Japan's defense ministry to suspend construction on a new marine base, after he found out it was damaging coral reefs. Many residents also don't like the bases, since 90% of the population lives on the southern third of the island, which is where many of the bases are located. In fact, less than 1% of Japan's population has to deal with the majority of the bases. Factor in the 1995 rape incident, and there is no reason why the residents wouldn't be upset about the bases.

It is important to keep up good relations with Japan and to help their economy. According to CNN, they now hold the largest amount of U.S. debt than any other country, starting in April. If Japan stays successful, they can subsidize and invest in our government. Since obviously the U.S will keep having to borrow money from other countries, it is best that the ones with the most money available still have it to lend to us. So, to help appease residents of Okinawa and benefit both of our countries, we must affirm this resolution.
