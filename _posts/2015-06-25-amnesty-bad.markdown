A few months ago, I was doing some fundraising outside a Bi-Lo. A kind lady came up to me and said, “I’m not going to buy anything from you, but I was just wondering, where exactly are you from?” Being a proud New Yorker, I replied, “Well, I was born and raised in upstate New York, but my parents are originally from China.” “Wow! My daughter has a Chinese exchange student living with her, and I thought you reminded me of her!” Just because I’m Asian. Okay, that was just an amusing little anecdote, but the fact remains that I am the child of immigrants. Legal immigrants. And it’s for people like my parents and many of my friends that I must negate this bill because of Section 3B: Illegal immigrants, who can establish residency within the United States for a period of 5 or more years, shall be granted amnesty and shall be fast tracked through the immigration progress.

Amnesty is unfair to legal immigrants. While immigration laws may be strict, there is a legal way to immigrate to the United States – my parents, among others, were able to use this method. Derrick Morgan of Slate Magazine, tells us on October 8, 2013, that these people who respect the law and wait to come are languishing in line. Those without such scruples are allowed to reside here and ultimately get legal status. Essentially, granting amnesty to illegal immigrants amounts to rewarding them for breaking the law. 

Amnesty shows that breaking the law really doesn’t matter. Undocumented immigrants cross the border illegally, and if we grant amnesty to those who have committed a crime, we could be opening the door for even more crimes of different, more serious natures, as well as future immigrants to believe they can cross the border without getting in trouble, says David Inserra of the Heritage Foundation on August 14, 2014.
