“Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won’t even want to come out of their caves.” So spoke Tony Stark, my personal favourite superhero. Of course, the Jericho is later used by the people who it was supposed to be fired against, killing many innocent civilians. However, if these cluster munitions can be used to such detriment against the innocent, think of how effective they are against the guilty.

Cluster munitions are effective. Major Christopher P Hill, a US army assistant product manager, writing for the Defence Acquisition University in November 2013, explains that in July 2012, the US fired at a target area with 36 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System unitary warhead rockets. Analysis indicated that the same effects could have been made by four cluster rockets. If cluster weapons cannot be used, the same operation would require using nine times as many rockets, cost nine times as much (3.6 million compared to 400k), and take 40 times as long (20 minutes compared to 30 seconds).

There are already motions in place to make cluster munitions safe. Andrew Feickert and Paul K Kerr of the Congressional Research Service tell us on April 29, 2014, that the Army is already currently involved in efforts to reduce cluster munitions failure rates, which are the current main cause of civilian deaths. For example, the Army decided to cease procurement of the Dual-Purpose Improved Conventional Munition warhead because its submunitions had a dud rate up to 5%. Furthermore, the Air Force has also acquired cluster munitions that comply with the less than 1% failure rate instituted by the Department of Defence.

Tony Stark may have ceased production of the Jericho (and all other weapons) after his stint in the Middle East to focus on humanitarian efforts, but he’s a private individual, and we as the United States cannot afford to do the same.
