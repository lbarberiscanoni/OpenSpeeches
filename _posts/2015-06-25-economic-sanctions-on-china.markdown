When asked how “natural slaves” should be identified, both my AP US teacher and Aristotle replied, “Slaves must be told what to do. Free men know their duty.” While I’m not condoning slavery in any way, shape or form, we do have to remember that we know our duty. Senators, I urge you to remember why we are here – not to fix global issues or control other countries, per se, but instead to do what is best for the American people. 

Imposing economic sanctions on China would be detrimental to the United States. China is the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury bills, bonds and notes. Their role as America’s banker gives them leverage – they can threaten to sell their holdings if America pressures it to do something. However, because China and the US have a symbiotic relationship, their economy also depends oupon exports to the United States. Should sanctions be imposed upon China, their economy would be hard-pressed to keep itself afloat, which could potentially lead to a large crash, according to a July 2014 article in the Wall Street Journal. While this depression in China’s economy is the end goal of the sanctions, if this came to pass it would ultimately be to the detriment of our own constituency, the very people we are here to represent.

There is no international law China is violating with its carbon emissions. The resolution especially mentions the Kyoto Protocol, but, as an April 2014 article from CNN tells us, China was not bound by the Kyoto Protocol because it was still considered a developing nation. There are no other “international laws” in place that China is violating.

We are at just as much fault as China is. According to the 2013 report released by the European Commission and Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, China’s emissions may be more than those of any other country, but China also has more people than any other country. Looking at the emissions per capita, Australia came first in 2012, followed by the United States ourselves – China doesn’t show up until the 11th place. If anything, we should push to lead by example and reduce our own carbon emissions, which has the added benefit of benefitting our constituency.

China and the United States recently agreed on a joint plan. As part of the agreement, Mr. Obama announced that the United States would emit 26 percent to 28 percent less carbon in 2025 than it did in 2005. That is double the pace of reduction it targeted for the period from 2005 to 2020. China’s pledge to reach peak carbon emissions by 2030, if not sooner, is even more remarkable. To reach that goal, Mr. Xi pledged that so-called clean energy sources, like solar power and windmills, would account for 20 percent of China’s total energy production by 2030.

Senators, let’s know our duty – our duty to our people. Stand with me and negate this bill for the good of American citizens.
