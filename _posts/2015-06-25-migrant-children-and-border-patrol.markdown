Sixteen-year-old G.G. was apprehended in Texas by Border Patrol agents who told her they would kill her if she tried to run. She was detained by Customs and Border Protection for a total of nine days in five different detention centres—each one worse than the last. CBP officials fed her mouldy bread | and, when she vomited, accused her of being pregnant and called her a “dirty liar.” Her bed consisted of paper on the floor of her cell and the bathroom, was covered in used toilet paper and sanitary pads. “You’re the garbage that contaminates this country,” CBP officials told her.

According to Caitlin Dickson of the Daily Beast on June 11, 2014, ‪this is just one of 116 different, yet equally horrifying, tales included in a report on alleged abuses perpetrated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection against unaccompanied immigrant children.‬‬‬

These children are coming to the United States to escape poverty and violence, | and what do we do? We greet them with abuse. I negate this bill because pumping more money into the border patrol is only going to worsen the abuse.

Karen McVeigh of the Guardian elaborates on the situation – More than half of the 116 children reported verbal abuse, and one in four reported physical and sexual abuse, including one teenager who said she was raped by a CBP officer. More than half also said they were denied medical care, including two young mothers whose infants became sick while detained in freezing temperatures. About 70% of the 116 children reported being held beyond the legally mandated 72-hour period. Many reported being painfully shackled, including two pregnant women who complained that they had been subjected to three-point shackles, which hurt their abdomens. This is not the America the Founding Fathers fought for. This is not the America my parents came to for a better life. This is not what we are about, and it needs to stop. When the borders between right and wrong are blurred, so is the rule of law. Instead of increasing oversight on the border, we need to increase oversight on the border patrol and stop these atrocities.

Senators, I urge you to stand with me and negate this bill. Negate for GG. Negate for the other 115 children. And negate for the voiceless who have been, and otherwise would be abused.
