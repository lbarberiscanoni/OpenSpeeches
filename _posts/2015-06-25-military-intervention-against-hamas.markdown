This bill is too vague. Worded like a resolution – how much money are we going to spend? What kind of resources? No oversight.

If military – bad. Because there is no oversight in this bill, we have no way of making sure that Israel uses our aid to fight terrorism, and only to fight terrorism. Josh Ruebner, former Middle East Affairs analyst at the Congressional Research Service, tells us that Israel has shown in the past that it is more than willing to misuse US weapons provided for a certain cause against other perceived “enemies” – for example, the Israeli military has repeatedly used US-supplied tear gas intended for combat against armed and dangerous Palestinian soldiers to instead break up Palestinian unarmed protests, killing both Palestinians and US citizens. Although this bill says that the aid is supposed to be used to fight Hamas and other terrorist organisations, there is no mechanism that allows us to make sure that is the only thing Israel uses this aid to fight.
