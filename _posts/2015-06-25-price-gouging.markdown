The federal government does not have the right to regulate price gouging. The bill does not provide an adequate definition for price gouging, and the federal government cannot enforce something that is up to the states to define. Price gouging also does not fall under any of the federal government’s delegated powers, expressed or otherwise. Furthermore, price gouging is already regulated by state governments and, as a matter of fact, is outlawed in 38 states. 

Allowing price gouging actually encourages citizens to be more prepared for disasters. If people are aware that prices of necessities will go up should a disaster occur, they will be more likely to stock up on resources instead of planning on just making a run to the store should anything happen, according to the Mises Institute in 2012. This preparation can benefit citizens when they are in situations that don’t allow them to leave their home – for example, they could be snowed in, or there could be a hurricane. It also reduces the chances of stock running low in stores, leading to conflicts between customers and an end result of no one getting what they need.
