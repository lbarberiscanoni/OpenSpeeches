Private prisons contribute to increased mass incarceration. Cindy Chang of the Times-Picayune on May 13, 2012 tells us that Louisiana, for example, has the highest incarceration rate in the United States, with one out of 86 behind bars. Why? The hidden engine behind the state's well-oiled prison machine is cold, hard cash. A majority of Louisiana inmates are housed in for-profit facilities, which must be supplied with a constant influx of human beings or a $182 million industry will go bankrupt. Furthermore, the sheriffs earn roughly $25 per inmate per day, so they have a great incentive to keep prison population low. The Sheriff's Association is one of the most powerful lobbies in the state. And they've consistently opposed any change that would reduce the prison population.

Lack of oversight. According to DM Levine of Fortune Magazine on August 18, 2010, three convicted murderers escaped from a prison in Kingman, a small town along Route 66 in northwest Arizona. According to reports, the inmates had broken free from the facility by using a pair of wire cutters. Gubernatorial candidate Terry Goddard said that he believes a big part of our problem is that the very violent inmates, like the three that escaped, ended up getting reclassified [as a lower risk] quickly and sent to private prisons that were just not up to the job.
