Human trafficking. Men, women, and children are trafficked from these Central American countries into the United States, where they are subjected to sex trafficking and forced labour, both in Central America and the United States. For example, according to the CIA World Factbook, Honduras is on the Tier 2 Watch List, Honduras does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. These efforts will be greatly bolstered by the aid this bill proposes. 

Increase the rule of law and decrease violence. Isabella Cota of the Guardian tells us on July 4, 2013, that Honduras has a murder rate of 86 per 100,000 inhabitants and one of its major cities, San Pedro Sula is the most dangerous city in the world, with 173 murders per 100,000 people. Furthermore, gang violence in El Salvador is one of the major causes of death, with an average of 8.9 homicides per day at the beginning of 2014 despite a truce between the countryâ€™s two main gangs, says the Huffington Post on April 8, 2014. Military and humanitarian aid can help reduce this violence.
