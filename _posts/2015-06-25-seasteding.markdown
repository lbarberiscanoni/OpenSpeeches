Ocean conservationists often say, “The ocean is like a public bathroom. No one owns it, so no one has an incentive to keep it clean.” The same principle can be applied to overfishing – because no one owns the well-stocked areas, no one has any incentive to keep the fish there, year after year. I stand in firm affirmation of this bill because it can help solve the problem of overfishing in the United States.

Overfishing is a problem in the US. Ros Krasny of the Chicago Tribune tells us on September 12, 2012 that national fishery disasters were declared by the U.S. Commerce Department for the northeast United States and Alaska because of extremely low stocks of key fish species that same month. Although steps were taken to reduce catch limits, several key fish stocks in the formerly teeming waters of the Gulf of Maine and on the Georges Bank off the New England coast are not rebuilding, according to former Secretary of Commerce Rebecca Blank. Because of this, members of our constituency, specifically fishermen in these areas, are losing their source of income, and current measures to solve this issue are not doing nearly enough.

Privatising the oceans will help mitigate overfishing. To solve this problem, we should look to the private sector as we have many times before – for example, the idol of American society – the internet. Currently, corporate fisheries find an area teeming with fish, set themselves up, and take every last bit of slippery, scaly, and sopping wet fish they can get before moving on, leaving next to no fish to keep the area well stocked. Local fishermen also practice this, to a lesser extent. However, as a September 17, 2010 Discovery News article tells us, if a fishery has the sole claim to a tract of ocean, they can’t just vacuum up all the fish and move on – they have much more of an incentive to stay and carefully cultivate the fish population in their region, thereby solving the overfishing problem.
