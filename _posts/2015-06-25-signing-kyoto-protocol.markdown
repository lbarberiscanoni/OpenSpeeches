We have seen our emissions fall without the Kyoto Protocol. According to the press release by the UN in 1997 when the Kyoto Protocol was first created, the original objective for all countries who ratified the protocol was to reduce their carbon emissions by 5.2% by 2012. However, data from the US Energy Information Administration in 2012 shows that U.S. total CO2 emissions for coal, oil and natural gas were 5,584 (million) metric tons in 1997. In 2012, U.S. CO2 emissions fell to 5,293 (million) metric tons. That is 291 (million) metric tons less than they were in 1997 and 730 (million) metric tons less than their 2007 peak. 291 (million) metric tons below 1997 levels is a 5.2% reduction in CO2 emissions. It EXACTLY meets the Kyoto requirement, and we were the first to reach said requirement.
