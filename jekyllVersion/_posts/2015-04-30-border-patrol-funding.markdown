For decades, border patrol was in the hands of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  They were pitifully underfunded until the September 11th attacks.  That’s when the US Customs and Border Protection was created, and now they receive crazy amounts of money that have little effect.  So we need to negate this bill to provide extra funding to border patrol because of the amount of funding that is wasted, and because of corruption and irresponsibility in the system.

According to the Immigration Policy Center, $100 billion has been invested into the current border patrol by the US government.  In fact, more money has been spent on it than the combined budgets of the FBI, ATF, DEA, Secret Service, US Marshals, and the NYPD annual budget, according to Politico magazine. Border Patrol Agent Christian Sanchez from Port Angeles often turned down overtime pay that he felt he didn’t deserve, since he barely did anything in that relatively safe area.  Now, this started back when the original INS was disbanded.  The government wanted to grow the border patrol as much as possible, and so the CBP officers grew in numbers that compromised the whole system, because with that many people that quickly, corruption and misconduct becomes inevitable, which leads to my next point.

The reason that money is wasted so much is because of dishonesty, corruption, and misconduct in the system.  The US Government Accountability Office reports almost one misconduct every day.  One stands out especially.  Esteban Manzanares, a Texas border patrol agent found a mother from Honduras and her two daughters.  He locked them in his car and then proceeded to rape them.  He tried to kill them and left them in the woods to die.  They were found, and when other patrol officers showed up at his apartment, he shot himself.  But there are more examples of agents conspiring with outside parties (Center for Investigative Reporting). Luis Alarid, smuggled drugs in San Diego, 2008.  Mario Alvarez, bribery, El Centro, California, 2006.  Ronald Merker, bribery and smuggling, Miami, 2007.  There is even embezzlement, such as when Todd Tyo of St. Lawrence County was found to have stolen over $1,000 from border patrol funds.  There are hundreds of examples of misconduct and treachery in the system, and until this is fixed, any extra funding that goes to border patrol will be wasted through theft or through investigations on the inside… the wrong side to be investigating.

To sum it up, there are too many problems in the system for any extra funding to be used wisely.  Between the abundance of staff that gets paid to do nothing and the abundance of corruption and misconduct within the ranks, it is evident that the CBP could cut costs itself because of their wasteful nature.  And for that, we must negate this bill. Thank you.
