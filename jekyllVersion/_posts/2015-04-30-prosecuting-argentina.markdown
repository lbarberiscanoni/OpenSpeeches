I oppose today’s legislation because I opposed the US and the UN efforts to deprive the Argentinians of their political right to govern their country.
	
Specifically, today’s legislation conflicts with the Argentinian’s efforts to bring justice to Nisman.  This resolution states that “the Argentinean government has ruled the death a suicide and will not proceed with any further investigations” but this could not be further from the truth. 2 days ago the Buenos Aires Herald reported that not only that the investigation on Nisman’s death will proceed, but that the new prosecutor Viviana Fein will also continue the probe against the government. The  New York Times of March 5 confirms that Fein will continue until Nisman’s death can decisively be ruled either a suicide or homicide. Passing this resolution will just go against the Argentinian efforts to bring light to this matter, which will turn the Argentinians against us. 

And why shouldn’t Argentina object to our intrusion? We would be intruding in their local politics, trying to influence their government for our own gain as we have done countless time in the past in South America. At best, today’s legislation will be ineffective because the Argentinian people themselves will see us as imperialistic, and will perceive the UN investigation as a violation of their right to national sovereignty. 

Second and most importantly, this violation of Argentina’s national sovereignty also will negative repercussions on international law as a whole. According to the Rome Statue, The International Criminal Court, the court that deals with cases brought froth by a UN investigation, is not allowed to hear or prosecute cases if individual states are “unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution”. Since Argentina is still in the process of investigating Nisman’s death, the ICC cannot prosecute or hear the case, and therefore neither can the UN.  This is why passing this bill breaks down this principle called “complementarity”, and thereby undermine international law as a whole since now the UN can just start investing people left and right without checks and balances. 

In essence, negate with me today out of respect for the Argentinians. Negate with me because justice should not be imposed by a foreign entity, but it should rather be embraced by the local people themselves.
