Earlier this year, Mrs. Louise Howard, an 86 year old woman from Tennessee, after having been systematically victimized by criminals, neutralized an armed robber by shooting her gun. She did exactly what the commercial says: she waited “for the moment to be right”…and demonstrated that “she didn’t choose the thug life, the thug life chose her”. To your concerned faces I say: we all like to think that when our grandma puts down the brownies, that she can take her of herself…if not: SHAME ON YOU!  Mrs. Howard’s story is at the core of the debate on today’s amendment, for it would disempower the thousands often defenseless people that share her story.

This constitutional amendment is predicated upon a flawed understanding of the concept of a militia. The affirmation contends that limiting gun ownership to militias will deprive mass murders of the tools for massacre: but the claim is not merely overstated, but is plain not true. For the Militia Act of 1903 groups all abled bodied people from the ages 17 to 48 into the category of reserve militias…de facto nullifying the legislation’s attempt at ameliorating gun control in this country.

Specifically, passing today’s amendment would undermine decades of supreme court rulings, from US v Cruiskshank to DC v. Heller, and ship our country off into a sea-storm of legal ambiguity because our gun laws, both on a federal and state level, have been grounded on the interpretation of the 2nd amendment as it stands. At best, today’s legislation exacerbates the problem of gun related deaths, by removing the tools of the father in Arizona that shot the man trying to rape his 4 and 7 year old daughters. Of the meat store employee in Ohio that repelled a gang of robbers. And of the over 100,000 people that, according to Harvard professor David Hemenway, used a gun defensively last year alone.
