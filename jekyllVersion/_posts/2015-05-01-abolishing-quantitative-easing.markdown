If there is one thing we all learned from the Hangover, the only thing that matters at the end of the day is whether you will regret the choices you have made when you wake up in the morning. Economics is the study of the choices we make when allocating scarce resources. It’s time to wake up ladies and gentlemen, because the Federal Reserve’s rounds of quantitative easing constitute the choices we will regret for the rest of our lives, or for some of you, your time in office ;)

Quantitative easing is the procedure by which the Federal Reserve acquires overvalued assets from banks, increasing the money supply in the process. It was initially developed as a drastic measure to respond to crises such as the one in 2009, but beginning with the last round of quantitative easing, the Federal Reserve has begun using it an attempt at stimulating economic growth. Gonzalo Lira explains on Business Insider on August 23rd of 2012 however, that “When the Federal Reserve buys toxic assets from banks, it does not promote stability, but instead sparks uncertainty about the quality of the bank’s strategies in the first place. Investors will thus withdraw capital from US banks and store it abroad, thus creating the beginning of a financial crisis.” Thus, QE provides short term relief at the expense of long term stability, and the instability it creates metastasizes all across the US economy. 

Furthermore, QE is also the leading cause of inflation, which has terrible economic consequences. Specifically, QE increases the money supply, and the more US dollars are in circulation, the less valuable they become. Bill Flax, explains on Forbes on June 20th 2012 that “inflation diminishes the real value of one’s savings and one’s wage, while simultaneously discouraging investment as lenders and spenders begin to question the real value of their assets”. And while QE has been justified as an attempt at decreasing unemployment, this is empirically not the case. Lawrence Katz, professor of Economics at Harvard University, explains in his book “Reflections on the US Labour Market” that “artificially increasing inflation disturbs the natural rate of unemployment, which inherently fluctuates because of shifts in supply and demand” Thus, increasing inflation only encourages outsourcing as workers demand higher wages to be able to afford the newly priced food to feed their families with. 

So let’s not fall into the Hangover, Part IV: the Federal Reserve Strikes Back.  Let’s all do what’s best for our country by ending Quantitative Easing and voting in favor of this legislation.
