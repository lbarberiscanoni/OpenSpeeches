Dreams. They’re the reason my family left China for this country. Dreams of a government ran by the people. Dreams of the freedom to express what you believed without fear of being sent to a conce- I mean, labor camp. Dreams of a sky that’s 50 shades of blue rather than one shade of grey, or even worse: 50 shades of grey. 
America is a melting pot. And there’s a reason that cliché exists. Because immigrants make this country great. But it is due to my experience and the experiences of millions of immigrants across America that I cannot support this bill. Because while at first glance, it makes immigration easier, in reality this legislation undermines the citizenship that legal immigrants everywhere work so hard to gain. 

The main issue with this legislation is that it penalizes legal immigration.  
	* Section 1, undocumented citizens have to live in US for five years. 
	* The problem is that this is much shorter than the time legal immigrants have to wait; legal residents have to live here 5 years to qualify for citizenship. But before they even become residents, foreigners must obtain a green card. 
	* Washington Post Article from January 31, 2013: over 4.5 million people waiting in line for green cards. Family members 7 to 24 years, while most workers 6 to 10. No citizenship test. Undermines legal citizenship.  (*Professionals with advanced degrees 0 wait time except China/India (5/8))

This bill incentivizes illegal immigration
	* Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, explains in a Sept. 24 art. from the CSM that illegal immigration is mainly an issue of incentives. Potential illegal immigrants are rational, and come because the positive benefits outweigh the risks. 
	*This bill effectively makes those risks zero. And it goes farther, illegal easier.
