Because of our “extensive experience” on the matter, we congressmen often remark that promises are like babies: easy to make but difficult, and very painful to deliver. The advent of BRIC and the EU has prompted us to make a myriad of these promise in the hope of consolidating our political relationships in the most effective way possible.

The well-intentioned purpose of today’s promise has blinded us to the dangers of diluting the exceptional importance of our free trade agreements. Specifically, in the process of pursuing a free trade agreement with the Mercosur, we would be undermining our much stronger trade relationships. 

The affirmative appeal to the economic benefits of such agreement is predicated upon a flawed understanding of South American politics. To begin with, the trading policies of the Mercosur are already collapsing under the internal inconsistency of its organization: the two largest economies in the trading block, Brazil and Argentina, already favor each other over the Mercosur because of the Treaty of Buenos Aires. Similarly, Paraguay and Uruguay are establishing their own free trade agreements, which is making the trading cooperation of the Mercosur even more difficult to enforce.  

Thus the idea that joining the Mercosur would advance us economically is not merely overstated: it is plain not true! Because the Treaty of Asuncion of 1991 would exclude us from “most-favored nation” status which is the basis upon which countries benefit from free trade agreements.

But the larger concern lies in our unilateral disregard of our free trade agreements with Chile, Peru and Columbia, which would inevitably lose value as we would extend those same economic privileges to these countries’ main competitor: the Mercosur. Joseph Nye, former dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, explains in his book “The Future of Power” that “breaching international agreements communicates selfishness, which in turn undermines our credibility in the international arena in multi efforts necessary for both our economic gain (such as in the case of NAFTA) and our national security (such as in the case of NATO).”
