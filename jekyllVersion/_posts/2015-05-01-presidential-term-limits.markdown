Frank Underwood from House of Cards said it best “For those of us climbing at the top of the food chain, there can be no mercy. There is but one rule: hunt or be hunted.” That’s the world we live in my fellow Senators, because, truth be told, every politician harbors presidential aspirations…just like Frank Underwood. What’s odd about our ambition is that we dedicate a whole lot of our lives to get a job that statistically gets you killed almost as often as a drug dealer, because ewe have become intoxicated with the 20th century notion that being President is an award, not a duty, for being the rule of US politics.

To rectify the trajectory of the presidency, we need a system that shifts responsibility away from the single hands of the presidency and into the democratically elected Congress. I object to today’s legislation because it only perpetuates the modern problems of the presidency.

The one appropriate aspect of the amendment is the 8-year term, because it shifts the administration away from short-term populistic goals and towards long-term and materially effective objectives. James Madison explains in 62nd Federalist paper that “…continual change even of good measures undermines our national character by forfeiting the respect and confidence of other nations” Thus a longer presidency promotes consistency, which positively reaffirms reliability on both a foreign policy and economic standpoint.

The amendment however only further mischaracterizes the President as the supreme authority because the referendum only underscores his role in US politics, even though he is meant execute and not pass laws. Alexander Hamilton explains in the 70th Federalist paper that “a vigorous executive is inconsistent with the genius of the republican government” because historically “the great interests of society are sacrificed to the vanity, to the conceit, and to the obstinacy of charismatic individuals”. Our founding fathers would cringe at the sight modern Presidents promoting their agenda as party leaders from the oval office. A flat 8-year term would insulate the President from much of the political sphere, shifting the responsibility unto the Congress to check back against its behavior. Both James Madison in the 63rd and Alexander Hamilton in the 72nd Federalist paper, specifically highlight how the will of the community is what should drive this country, and that’s why the Congress is in charge of passing laws: because it’s most responsive to the people.
