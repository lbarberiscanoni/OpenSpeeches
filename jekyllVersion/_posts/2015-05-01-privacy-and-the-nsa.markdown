(This is speech was also in Emory finals so it changed a lot, but I will include the intro that made me notorious on the national circuit. Once again, it references a lot of people that were there)

Senator Traconis thinks we are friends: we are not! You see, because what she doesn't know is that I hacked into her snapchat account, and I have seen the kind of pictures she has been snapchatting...to senator McHugh. He also thinks we are friends btw, but we are not! Because whe HE doesn't know is that I also hacked into his snapchat account, so I have seen what he has been snapchatting to...senator Klein: we were never friends to begin with. You wanna know what's going to happen now? Senator Traconis will take her high heel and poke my eyes with it, Senator McHugh will try to strangle me with his tie, and Senator Klein will try to punch me in the face...if he can reach that high. (pause because people are laughing) my point is that whenever we know we are being watched, we alter our behavior, and that's what the righ to privacy is about.

The Inspector General internal investigation in 2007 found “that the 22% of FBI NSLs violated US Law”

Dr. Peter Swire, C4AP,  in his Testimony To US Senate Judiciary Committee “The FBI and the Department of Justice deliberately hid information from Congress during consideration of the application of Patriot Act.”

Eric Lichtbalue, NYT July 18, 2005 “The Justice Department disclosed in a federal lawsuit that the F.B.I. has gathered thousands of pages on the ACLU and Greenpeace movement”
