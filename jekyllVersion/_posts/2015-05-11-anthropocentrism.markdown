Making human needs the only priority prevents from developing a healthy relationship with nature and our ecosystem. This in turn prevents us from engaging in effective ways to improve our environment, and sustain our long-term existence. Only when we stop thinking about the now and humans, treating our environment as just a resource to use, can we live in harmony with nature without causing awful shit like global warming or world hunger.
