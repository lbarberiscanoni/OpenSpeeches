No serial number. Kyle Chayka’s “The Printed Gun: How 3D Printing Is Challenging Gun Control” explains that "The plastic printed gun was designed to fire bullets just as effectively as the standard metal version, yet it has no serial number and requires no permit. It also works."

Anyone can own. Time Oct. 10 2013 says "In March of 2012, he founded an organization called Defense Distributed, its sole mission to develop a freely available, open-source blueprint for a firearm that could be made entirely on an affordable 3D printer."

Wilson’s plan would allow anyone with a 3D printer to build their own firearm, avoiding the United States’ already loose system of identity and background checks meant to prevent deadly weapons from falling into the wrong hands. It would dismantle any efforts at gun control, proving top-down regulation useless. And that’s just what the gun’s inventor intended.
