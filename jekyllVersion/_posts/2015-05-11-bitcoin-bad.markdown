No control. Volatility – William Coates CEO of Digital Tunes "Probably the biggest problem with bitcoin is the volatile nature of its value relative to fiat currencies such as dollars or euros." We price the tracks on our store in euros, and the bitcoin value is calculated from the current exchange rate. This means that, if someone spends the equivalent of 100 euros in bitcoin on our store, then the value of bitcoin halves before we get a chance to convert it to euros, we lose 50 euros. Ouch.

However, BitPay provides a simple solution to this issue. If you choose to receive all payments in the fiat currency of your choice, such as euros, BitPay will instantly convert the payment to euros at the time of the transaction. As a result, you will always receive the exact euro amount (minus fees) that your product was priced at. In this manner, it is possible to completely remove the volatility risk for merchants accepting bitcoin.

Although it’s easy enough to eliminate the volatility risk for merchants, we also have to think about how volatility could affect our customers’ buying behaviour. One hypothetical problem is that, when the value of bitcoin is rising, people will be more likely to hold on to their coins rather than spend them. This ‘hoarding’ could obviously affect sales, at least in the short term.

Looking at our sales data for bitcoin, it’s quite clear that volatility does have an affect on customer behaviour. During periods when bitcoin is quickly rising in value, no-one wants to spend their coins. This makes sense: why would you shop today, if tomorrow you can get a 10% discount? However, after these surges, we often see a spurt of bitcoin transactions: presumably since people suddenly have some spare cash to play with.

It’s worth noting, though, that even after crashes we do still see transactions occurring. So it’s clear there is an underlying level of demand that is not entirely correlated with the current exchange rate value of bitcoin.
