Senators I’m sure you’ve all heard the typical cliché break-up phrase: “It’s not you, it’s me.” Ironically this phrase represents the current US-China Trade relationship. The problem lies with the US and not with China. While I applaud the fact that the author of this bill is addressing the issue of imbalance in trade with China, I urge you to stand in negation for the following three reasons: 1) This bill doesn’t provide the correct approach to resolve the imbalance of trade between the US and China, 2) Focusing on trade policies with China is not enough, and 3) US Exports to China are vital to our economy. 

This bill does not provide the correct approach. The US has negotiated with China regarding its trading policy for the past two decades; it first began with the Clinton Administration and has followed through into the Obama administration. This brings about the major question, why would China negotiate further with the US if we implicate trade sanctions upon them? The answer is, they wouldn’t. 

Focusing on China is not enough. According to Nicholas Consonery, an analyst from the Eurasia group, he states that “US consumers are as much a driver of today's economic imbalances as the Chinese government. We are a consumer-based economy; we spend money we don't have. Our demand is going to be satisfied somewhere, and if not in China it will be some other economy with cheap labor such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, or Indonesia.” So essentially the trade deficit we have with China will decrease but, we will have a new trade deficit due to these other cheap labor countries. Now this leads me to my third contention.

US Exports to China are vital to our economy. As was stated earlier the economy of the US is based on consumers. So the only way we can make up our trade deficit is with our exports. According to an article from China Business Review, "from 2001 to 2011 total US Exports rose by 542% which is 16.2 billion to 103.9 billion dollars, while around the rest of the world exports only increased by 80% in this time period." This statistic shows us that China has a demand for our exports and this demand will lower our trade deficit with them. 

Therefore instead of removing these special trade relationships we need to have freer trade with China so that our exports will balance the trade deficit and that is why I urge you to stand in negation.
