Here’s something some of you may not know about me: I’m not completely white.  My mother being Mexican, I know how to speak Spanish and I got to say that I’m Hispanic on college applications.  Yes, I get to avoid face-to-face discrimination by looking Caucasian, and I got to reap college benefits by being partly Hispanic.  Looking around this chamber, I can see that many ethnicities are represented.  Because of how the current admissions process works, some of your children will get denied or approved based on their race.  This is called affirmative action, known by some as positive discrimination.  But positive for one is negative for another, so we need to stop funding to colleges that still practice this because it is demeaning, it perpetuates stereotypes, and it gives unfair advantages to people who may not need or deserve them.

Giving away admissions or even scholarships based on race is downright insulting.  The colleges think that some ethnicities need the scholarships more than others; that is simply wrong.  Lowering standards for those groups is discriminatory and may cause their performances to lower based on lower expectations.  It will spread the idea that minorities aren’t as academically capable and that they need extra help.  The efforts to create a color-blind society backfire horribly with this in effect.

The alternative that this bill suggests is to instead give scholarships based on socioeconomic status.  The people that need the admissions are the people who wouldn’t normally have the opportunity.  How much money one makes is a real factor in whether or not they can go to college.  Making assumptions like that based on race is wrong.  High-income minorities in some cases get admissions and scholarships that low-income people need.

The rules on affirmative action need to change, because people who can’t pay for college need aid more than a generalized group of all minorities.  By giving scholarships based on race, you perpetuate stereotypes and take away from people who may be more qualified.  Our country continually adapts and evolves along with the changing times. It’s a country based on equality, and lately, it’s seemed like some people are more equal than others.
