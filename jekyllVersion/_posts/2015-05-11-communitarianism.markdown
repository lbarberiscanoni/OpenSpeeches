There is no such thing as "community": there are only individual people, separate by nature, who choose to cooperate for mutual benefit as they see fit. Failure to recognize individuality is both offensive (reducing people to socialist, robot workers or to drones in the Borg Collective) and counterproductive (discouraging individual efforts to excel). Arguments which give priority to the group over the individual set up a mindset which hurts people and hurts the quest for the common good.
