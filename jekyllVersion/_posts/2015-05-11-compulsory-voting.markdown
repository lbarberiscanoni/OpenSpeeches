What is a democracy? In our democracy, people have a say in their government through elected officials, like me.  But in order to have an accurate picture of what the people in our government want, we need as many people to vote as we can manage.  In fact, to get an accurate picture, we need everyone to vote.  Voting isn’t a privilege, it’s a responsibility.  We need to affirm this resolution and make voting mandatory, to let everyone have an equal say, educate the people, and eventually give the government a better idea of what the US citizens want.

According to the Huffington Post, 58.2% of eligible voters actually voted.  This is a little more than half, and it is baffling.  There are many reasons why some people don’t vote.  People who are poor or come from poor neighborhoods may have fewer opportunities to be educated about politics.  These people may not care enough to register to vote, and in the end they aren’t represented in government.

So how would people get educated?  Some people have said that compulsory voting will cause uneducated people to vote and ruin the results.  Well, if people are required to vote, we can trust that most of them will educate themselves.  After all, if they are required to have a say, they might as well know what they’re saying.  Researching the candidates doesn’t take long; you can just turn on a TV.  By passing this bill, people would educate themselves and create a society that knows more about their own government.

With all of this put together, we see that the government will have a better idea of what the US citizens want.  Even if the outcome of the election isn’t changed, it still makes a difference.  Let’s take the 2012 election.  Imagine if everyone who hadn’t voted for Obama had stayed home.  He still would have won, but a country in which Barack Obama has 100% of the vote is much different from a country in which he has 51.1% of the vote.  Because of everyone else, we know that almost half of the voters don’t agree with his policies, so he can make efforts to accommodate them.  Of course, he would have an even better idea with a better turnout.

So, senators, we need to affirm this resolution to give everyone a chance to educate themselves and vote, and thus become better at our own jobs.  It applies to congressmen as well as presidents.  This resolution will let us better represent our own constituents and maybe even get some of you reelected.  For these reasons, the resolution must pass.  Thank you.
