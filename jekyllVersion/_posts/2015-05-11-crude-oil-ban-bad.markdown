This legislation allows for a more efficient use of American resources. The US now produces more oil than ever before. According to the Energy Information Administration as of March 2014, crude oil production has risen by 99.5% since 2008, mainly due to developments in fracking and horizontal drilling 

However, the main problem is that the type of crude oil we’re currently extracting isn’t compatible with our current refineries. Blake Clayton of the Integrated oil research team at Citigroup stated last year that "most of our increased oil production is light crude, but the vast majority of our refineries are configured for lower-quality, heavy crude oil."

The result is an artificial abundance of crude, and the primary beneficiaries are oil refineries. Council for Foreign Relations states in June 2013, "refineries are profiting from buying crude at depressed prices then selling at market rates." I want our taxpayers to benefit from our resources, not just refineries. So export.  

Helps stabilize oil prices. Initial idea behind ban was that more oil in US means more stable prices. Has turned out to be not completely true. Nicolas Loris of the Heritage Foundation writes in May 2014 that "being a net importer of exporter of oil doesn’t really affect price volatility much because oil is a global commodity."

Rather, Loris states that a greater oil supply on the global market would help insulate consumers from price volatility and supply disruptions. This legislation does just that; It increases global supply by exporting US crude to places with the ability to refine it. 

Next, let’s look at some of the impacts of oil shocks that this bill helps alleviate. NYU Stern Economist Nouriel Roubini notes that "oil shocks have caused or contributed to each of the American and Global recessions over the last 30 years."
