Wasting money. Politico May 12 2013 "They say the millions of dollars the agency spends each year preparing for the possibility of a military draft is a waste of money." Also, "The Selective Service has a budget of $24 million and a full-time staff of 130. It maintains a database of about 17 million potential male draftees. In the event of a draft, the agency would mobilize as many as 11,000 volunteers to serve on local draft boards that would decide if exemptions or deferments to military service were warranted."

MEN punished. Associated Press Feb. 25 2013 "Men between the ages of 18 and 25, who often register online or by mail, who don't register with the Selective Service can be charged with a felony. The Justice Department hasn't prosecuted anyone for that offense since 1986. There can be other consequences, though. Failing to register can mean the loss of financial aid for college, being refused employment with the federal government, and denied U.S. citizenship." DeFazio says it makes no sense to threaten to penalize men who don't register when the odds of a draft are so remote. Huffington Post Nov. 2 2013 "It's quick, it's easy and it's the law," young men have been told ever since, but you must read the fine print to discover that failure to register comes with hefty potential penalties: a maximum of 5 years in a federal prison and/or a $250,000 fine. In addition, failure to comply with the law can disqualify you from certain federal jobs (and state jobs in some places)."
