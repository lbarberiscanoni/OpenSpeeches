Jack Kevorkian is known by some as Dr. Death.  He’s known by some as a hero.  The undisputable fact is that he assisted over 130 terminal patients in voluntary euthanasia.  He even famously said that “Dying is not a crime”.  He went to jail for second-degree murder.  With this bill, I’m trying to make it so that people who don’t want to prolong their death can avoid it without anyone going to jail.  We need nationwide legalization of euthanasia to stop people from needlessly suffering, and because the government has no right to punish people who try to end the suffering.

If a person doesn’t have long to live, they should be able to hasten their death.  That is, they should be able to do so without the doctor being prosecuted.  Right now it is legal in Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Montana.  I’m not really saying that everyone would be afforded access to euthanasia, but just that a physician who euthanizes a terminal patient can’t be prosecuted for it.  Pew Research Center conducted a poll in 2006 that determined that 86% of people support the right-to-die.  If it’s already legal for a patient to refuse care (which can basically be suicide), it should be legal to allow a patient to die. 

Sometimes it can even help in some other unexpected ways.  If a person wants to stop being kept alive by treatments that will have no permanent effect, they can prevent their families from needlessly spending money.  It would even let hospitals use those resources for other patients who have a higher chance of survival.  Another way it could help other patients is with donating organs.  By letting doctors euthanize patients, they make sure that the patient dies in a controlled way that doesn’t harm their organs, so the organs can be donated to people who need them.

Euthanasia must be legalized.  It is wrong that doctors who attempt it are put in jail.  It is a right that should be afforded to people who are in pain and want to end it on their own terms.  For these reasons, senators, I urge you to vote affirmative on this bill.
