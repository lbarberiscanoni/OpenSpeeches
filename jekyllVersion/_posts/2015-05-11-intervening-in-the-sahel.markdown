As we look at today’s legislation we need to see the benefits of unilateral intervention.

First let’s look at the failed attempts with multilateral intervention. Taylor Seybolt, from University of Pittsburgh , analyzed 17 military interventions in 6 countries in the last 20 years, and concludes that “the UN's lack of a standing military inhibts its ability to save lives compared to unilateral actors. Out of five UN operations, two had a mixed record and the other three were abject failures in terms of lives saved. In comparison, seven out of nine non-UN efforts saved lives.” 

Multilateral intervention clearly fails time and time again to accomplish; however, for unilateral intervention the success rate was much higher. Taylor Seybolt, from University of Pittsburgh, analyzed 17 military interventions in 6countries in the last 20 years, and concludes that 9 out of 17 humanitarian cases were conclusive successes in terms of lives saved and saved at least 160,000 lives overall with unilateral intervention.” 

But lets look at the impact of having a multilateral intervention compared to a unilateral intervention. By having multiple countries involved in trying to resolve an international issue, violations for human rights grow leading to a growth in terrorism. Rosemary Foot from Oxford University write “States with gross violations of human rights generally tend to provide the base from which terrorist cells can operate, and are heavily linked to transnational terrorism. Burke-White , from Princeton, explains that “Since 1990, countries' human rights violations have provided a great indicator of propensity towards aggression and risk of getting WMD.Thus this can be avoided with US humanitarian intervention.
