Liberalism contains four assumptions: 

Both state and non-state actors are important in international relations. Liberalism directly contrasts realism because it places a great deal of value on "substate actors," like individuals or multi-national corporations. Microsoft, a company that earns as much as the GNP as the 9th largest country in the world, can affect global politics by controlling how and what kind of information people can access. Jesse Jackson influenced global politics when he negotiated the release of American fighter pilot Scott O'Grady from the Bosnian government. 

The state is not necessarily a unitary and rational actor. This assumptions recognizes that leaders must play bi-level games in which they must simultaneously negotiate with foreign leaders but also make choices that keep their own constituents happy. An example of this is the United States' ongoing refusal to pay UN dues. Foreign aid and contributions to the United Nations would total less than 1% of America's budget, but a popular campaign strategy of Congressmen is to argue that the United States sends too much of our tax dollars abroad. Congressmen therefore would compromise their promises to their constituents by paying UN dues and hence will not authorize the president to do so. Consequently, what might be rational (in our best interest)--paying our dues in order to reduce the wrath of our fellow UN members--cannot come to be. 

The nature of international relations includes both conflict and co-operation. Liberals believe that because states are connected by trade and finance, they have an incentive not to alienate one another. This rationale is a good reason for nations to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers. A second part of this assumption is the democratic stability theory which rests on the observation that no two democratic states have ever gone to war with one another, and that democratic states rarely strike first. Liberals argue that democracies identify with one another because of their shared norms and values--the United States doesn't want to take over Canada (and vice versa) partly because each country believes that citizens have the right to choose their own government and consequently believe that conquering another country and enslaving its citizens is wrong. Moreover, democracies are not dominated by the military and the decision to go to war does not lie in the hands of an individual or a small group; leaders are accountable to their people, who are often reluctant to see their children go to war. 

A variety of issues can dominate the international agenda. Unlike realists, liberals believe that national security does not always have to be of paramount importance--economics, environmental issues, and human rights can all become the most important goal of a nation.
