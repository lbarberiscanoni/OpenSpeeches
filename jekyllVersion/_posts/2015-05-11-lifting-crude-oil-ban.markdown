Production. U.S. Energy Information Administration, “Petroleum & Other Liquids: U.S. Field Production of Crude Oil,” March 28, 2014, http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCRFPUS2&f=M (accessed April 21, 2014).
 U.S. Energy Information Administration, “Petroleum & Other Liquids: Drilling Productivity Report,” April 14, 2014, http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/drilling/#tabs-summary-2 (accessed April 21, 2014). "Crude oil production in the United States has skyrocketed in the past six years, in large part due to technological advances in hydraulic fracturing, commonly referred to as fracking, and horizontal drilling. As a result of these advanced drilling and extraction techniques, crude oil production has increased by 99.5 percent since 2008, the year when production reached its lowest point since 1943.[3] Over 90 percent of all oil-production growth in the U.S. now results from fracking.[4]"

Oil independence. According to the Hill May 13 2014 "For the first time in nearly 20 years crude oil production in the U.S. surpassed foreign imports, leading  a number of lawmakers on both sides rallying behind the idea of lifting the ban."

Production has taken off at such an unexpected rate that the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) now estimates that the U.S. will not need to import any oil whatsoever by 2037, a proposition that would have been unheard of only a few years ago.[6] Already, in 2012, the amount of oil produced in the U.S. surpassed the amount it imported.[7]
