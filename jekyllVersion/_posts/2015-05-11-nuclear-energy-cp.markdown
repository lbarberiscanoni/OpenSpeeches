The journalist, H. L. Mencken, once said: “If a politician found he had cannibals among his constituents, he would promise them missionaries for dinner.” The coincidence is that I am one of these politicians. I hail from the classy state of South Carolina and my fellow constituents oppose this legislation and this is due to the new nuclear power plants we have established this year. 

Section 1 of this legislation states that “40% of the Department of Energy’s annual renewable energy budget shall be redirected into Geothermal Energy Research and the funding will be allocated from the existing budget for renewable energy.” What this means is that any money being spent on other forms of renewable energy shall be cut to make up for this geothermal research. This harms my constituents greatly because according to a White House Press release, “the Department of Energy allocates 2.5 billion dollars for its renewable energy budget, this includes $310 million for the SunShot Initiative to make solar energy cost competitive nationwide without subsidies by the end of the decade, $95 million for wind energy, including off-shore wind technologies; and $65 million for geothermal energy and enhanced geothermal systems. The Budget also provides $770 million for the Office of Nuclear Energy, which includes funding for advanced small modular reactors.”

These small reactors include 8 within my home state. If this legislation passes, upkeep of these power plants will decrease significantly, possibly leading to the closing of these plants. According to Sun Shine State News, (which is a local South Carolina newspaper), on May 17, 2013, The V.C. Summer project brings multiple benefits to the state, including jobs, educational advancement for the next generation of workers at the plant and, most importantly, affordable electricity for more than 1 million additional homes and businesses. 

State Senator Creighton Coleman states “We are fortunate in South Carolina as eight nuclear plants provide more than half of the state’s electricity and more than 95 percent of the electricity that doesn’t emit greenhouse gases. The new reactors being built at V.C. Summer are around one-third complete and already are strengthening the state’s economy. More than 1,500 workers are working on the site and the project will create 3,000 to 3,500 jobs at peak construction over the next few years.”

US Rep. James E. Clyburn, representing the 6th district of South Carolina, recently held a town hall meeting in Columbia, where he discussed the economic and educational benefits nuclear energy is bringing to the state -- and especially to minority communities. Clyburn stated that these nuclear power plants provide 100,000 “quality, high-paying American jobs” with industry salaries about 36 percent higher than average salaries in the local area.

For the sake of my constituents I urge you fellow congressmen, fail this legislation.
