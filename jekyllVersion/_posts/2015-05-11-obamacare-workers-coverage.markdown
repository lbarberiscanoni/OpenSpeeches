What the bill does. Those changes to the employer responsibility requirements of the ACA would reduce the number of employers assessed penalties and lower the penalties assessed against employers that do not offer insurance (or offer insurance that does not meet certain criteria) and that have at least one full-time employee receiving a subsidy through a health insurance exchange As a result, the largest budgetary effect of H.R. 2575 would be to reduce the amount of penalties collected from employers.

Clear up confusion. National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) April 03, 2014 "PPACA marks the first time that “full-time” is expressly defined in law.Similarly, the Fair Labor Standards Act has long dictated that overtime pay starts after 40-hours per week.   Thus, employers and employees have long understood “full-time” to be equivalent to 40-hours per week."

Employee and Small Business Benefit. WashingtonTimes April 04 2014 "The 30-hour full-time definition is already resulting in less opportunities, fewer hours and lower incomes for employees. On top of increasing health care costs, this law is forcing businesses to slash hours, creating a part-time economy and leaving our families struggling to make ends meet. Because of Obamacare’s 30-hour rule, 2.6 million Americans making under $30,000 a year are at increased risk of having their hours and wages cut."

H.R. 2575 would provide some immediate relief for small-business owners and employees.  According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), H.R. 2575 would reduce taxes on employers by $63.4 billion over the next ten years.  For employees, the bill would prevent decreases in take home pay.
