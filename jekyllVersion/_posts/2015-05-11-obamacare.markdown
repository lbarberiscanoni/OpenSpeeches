"The White House says it's surpassed its goal for people enrolled in Obamacare. It's amazing what you can achieve when you make something mandatory and fine people if they don't do it, and keep extending the deadline for months."  With that many people signing up for it, there are bound to be mistakes, such as some people getting more or less credit than they were supposed to.  However, taking money back from people who already have it is not worth giving back to people who didn’t expect the money and have moved on.  We must negate this bill because of the detrimental effects it would have on the poor, and because we need to face up to the fact that we messed up. 

Reimbursements to the government would hurt the poor. According to the Wall Street Journal on Feb 20, 2015, for many taxpayers, the tax refund is their biggest payout of the year. If people who mistakenly got too much credit must reimburse the government, not only do they have to wait even longer for the tax refund that they might desperately need, but they also won’t get the extra money that they might have been counting on, not knowing that they weren’t supposed to get it.  This would cause many problems for poorer people who suddenly can’t pay their rent, or send their child to college.

The original credit promises may have been erroneous. The Annenberg Public Policy Centre tells us that, when tested, the estimates offered by healthcare.gov actually ended up being far less than the estimates offered by the actual insurance companies. While the website had told applicants that they may not have to pay as much as the estimate, nowhere on the website was it suggested that the actual premium may be far higher than the estimate. After that whole snafu, it’s the least we can do.  More money given to the citizens by accident is what they deserve after paying more money to the government.

Together, all we find is that passing this bill will only hurt the poor by making them poorer.  The government made a mistake, and we shouldn’t take the money back from the people who counted on it and need it to live.  And for that, representatives, we must negate.
