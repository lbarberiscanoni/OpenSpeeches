We need to affirm this bill because it will give people a fair chance for jobs and it isn’t effective on many levels.

First, this bill will unfairly take away the chances of some people to get jobs.  Oregon Marijuana activist Johnny Green (bachelor’s in public policy), who runs the popular website The Weed Blog, has even suggested that many more states may be in line to legalize the use of marijuana, such as California, Massachusetts, Arizona, Maine, and others, based on polls.  The number of people using marijuana is only going to grow, and many valuable workers are going to be part of this movement.  Removing them from the pool of possible employees is a huge loss.  Of course you can conduct these tests after the person is hired, it’s your company.  But the way a person is hired should be determined by how they act in the workplace, not their private hobbies.  If the person is found to be violating company rules, of course he can be fired.  But if it’s something he or she does in private, then that person shouldn’t be denied a job before they can even prove themselves at work.  In the rare case that a test comes back as a false positive, then the person would be denied a job even though they don’t use marijuana.

Second, pre-employment marijuana tests are effective in many aspects.  Dr. Edward Halperin conducted a study in 2008 that found that it takes about $93,160 for every positive pre-employment test, due to a .04% chance of getting a positive result.  This cost is even higher when you consider the costs external medical review officer and the follow-up drug test.  But that’s how expensive it is for drug tests that test for all drugs.  The chances of just finding marijuana are even slimmer.  Some people also say that just having the test in place will stop drug abusers from applying, but Halperin goes on to say that only 23% of employees are aware of the pre-employment drug tests.  The drug abusers would still come to the interviews just due to lack of awareness.  Those who are aware of the test would stop using the drugs anyway for the interview, so a surprise drug test after they are employed would be much more effective.

So, pre-employment drug tests unfairly affect the ability of marijuana users to get jobs, they are very expensive, and rarely yield results, we must affirm this bill and ban them.
