The argument of today’s legislation is a basic one and is something that we shouldn’t even spend a long time debating.  It’s the basic question of whether or not we should provide the President with the option of discussing the future of NAFTAs economic goals and policies with leaders of both Canada and Mexico. The answer is simple. Yes, we should provide the option. 

NAFTA is not a perfect economic policy – things can be changed. According to Investopedia on December 21, 2012 “NAFTA may have eliminated tariffs between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, but it didn't do away with the numerous customs regulation that can stifle trade.”

Rule of origin regulations decide whether a good qualifies for trade under NAFTA guidelines, and exporters must complete certificate of origin paperwork. More rules determine what records businesses must keep for trades under NAFTA and for how many years. Businesses that believe their goods have wrongly been deemed unqualified can go through an appeals process. Each of the three countries has a different procedure for NAFTA claims.

Issues regarding NAFTA are due to factors at home and abroad. According to the Huffington Post on May 14, 2014: "NAFTA did not address Mexico's underlying financial problems, as economic "fiefdoms" and monopolies continue to overpower the Mexican business sector. But as Zedillo pointed out, "NAFTA is only one part of the Mexican economy.""

Other factors, from the 1995 peso crisis to the solidification of democracy in Mexico, may have slowed some necessary reforms, like corruption within the Mexican Government
