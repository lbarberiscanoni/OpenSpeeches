Nelson Mandela once said that “no one truly knows a nation until one has been inside its jails.  A nation should not be judged on how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones”.  If that’s the case, then the US would definitely fall short as it is.  According to the World Prison Population List, we currently have 2.2 million people in prison, giving us both the highest number and percentage of prisoners in the world.  Many of these prisons are held in private state prisons, which definitely show a bad image of prisons in this great country.  I rise to the affirmative on this bill to end private prisons because they don’t provide high enough quality, and they harm the economy more than expected.

Private prisons should be banned because of their lack of quality and effectiveness.  This is because of the very fact that they are businesses that are looking to make a profit.  They spend as little money as they can to make that profit.  One example is when Regan Clarine, an inmate in one of Arizona’s prisons, was pregnant.  Doctors suggested she get an ultrasound, which was never provided.  She had to get a C-section because the doctors predicted the wrong delivery date, and they ended up putting kitchen sugar in her wound rather than antibiotics (a practice used in the early 1900s).  They then closed the wound with band-aids.  This was because of the state of Arizona privatizing health care.  In the first 8 months, 50 prisoners died, compared to 37 in the past two years combined (American Friends Service Committee).  GEO group also cut costs when at one point, they had 2 guards watching over as many as 256 juveniles.  These prisons make money on prisoners, so in an investors’ pitch, CCA reported they have high recidivism.  In other words, they were bragging about prisoners not being fully rehabilitated because it makes more money.

Private prisons also don’t save as much as is advertised.  According to the Arizona Department of Corrections, the states themselves are reporting more money spent.  In Arizona, up to $1,600 more per prisoner per year.  The prisons often use clever and hidden ways to get paid more.  The Department says, for example, that private prisons like to keep healthy or not as dangerous prisoners and send the rest to state prisons.  They then get paid the same amount for cheaper prisoners.  And back to that high recidivism: Prisoners leaving and repeatedly coming back provides short-term savings, but more spending in the long run.

If prisons were already bad, they get even worse through prison privatization.  The conditions in these prisons are borderline human rights violations, and they continue because they aren’t required to be as transparent as state prisons.  So, because of the bad quality and lack of saving, I urge you to vote affirmative on this bill.
