Stephen Colbert once said: “Look at our nations forefathers. Many arrived with nothing but the blouse on their back, but thanks to no minimum wage they started a booming cotton industry!” I stand in the affirmation to raise the minimum wage for the following contention that: The Minimum Wage provides a baseline allowing people to embark on the pursuit of happiness. 

Without a higher minimum wage, the lowest paid members of society are forced into slavery, and their decisions of these members often force others to follow suit, accepting similarly low wages. There is no real freedom of choice for people at this lowest level of the social structure, since they must accept whatever wage is offered in order to feed themselves and their families. Their poverty and desperation for work makes it much more difficult for them to bargain for better wages. 

According to Jerold Waltman, and his book The Politics of the Minimum Wage, 2000: “The minimum wage frees people from this slavery and guarantees them resources with which to make meaningful choices.”  Without resources there can be no true choice, as all choices would be coerced by necessity. Because people’s choices are intrinsically interconnected, and wages tend to reflect the prevailing pressures of demand and supply, when an individual makes the choice to work for less than anyone else, he necessarily lowers the wage that others can ask, leading to a downward spiral of wages as workers undercut one another, each competing to prove he is worth the least. 

A minimum wage ensures workers do not harm each other through self-destructive wage competition. According to Air Hillman and his book Responsibilities and Limitations of Government from 2009: “What the minimum wage does to alleviate these problems is that it gives individuals the ability to pursue the good life, something that has become a global ideal.” 

People want to be happy, and find that the only way to obtain the resources necessary to attain comfort and security is through employment. Fundamentally, the minimum wage grants the freedom not to be exploited, giving individuals the freedom to control their own destinies. According to Huffington Post on Dec 26, 2012 A  McDonald's worker, Aristides Burgos, said he earns $7.50 an hour, or a quarter above minimum wage, in New York City. The money is not enough to survive on in a place as expensive as Manhattan, he states."They have to pay us more, especially here in New York,".

So it is clear that we must protect our constituents and allow them to pursuit happiness by negating this legislation.
