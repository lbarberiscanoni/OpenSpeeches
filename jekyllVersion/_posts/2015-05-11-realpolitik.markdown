What is called "political realism" in foreign relations � also known by the German term Realpolitik � is the theory that power and immediate material interest should dominate over all other considerations. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy explains it this way: "Political realism is a theory of political philosophy that attempts to explain, model, and prescribe political relations. It takes as its assumption that power is (or ought to be) the primary end of political action, whether in the domestic or international arena. In the domestic arena, the theory asserts that politicians do, or should, strive to maximize their power, whilst on the international stage, nation states are seen as the primary agents that maximize, or ought to maximize, their power. The theory is therefore to be examined as either a prescription of what ought to be the case, that is, nations and politicians ought to pursue power or their own interests, or as a description of the ruling state of affairs � that nations and politicians only pursue (and perhaps only can pursue) power or self-interest." (www.utm.edu/research/iep/p/polreal.htm)

A Kritik of Realpolitik argues that political realism, which is the dominant mode of international relations these days, justifies mutual suspicion between nation and inevitably leads to a failure of arms control. If all nations are striving to achieve advantage over one another, then any action will be perceived as a play for additional power at the expense of other countries. Suspicion breeds paranoia and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. At the same time, by ignoring moral and ethical issues, realpolitik promotes immoral actions in the international arena. The argument claims that plans (or counterplans) acting through the normal mechanisms of international affairs, or cases which deal with the "threat" posed by other nations, entrench the viewpoint of political realism and make us unable to envision alternatives. Because political reason is an amoral vacuum, the debaters operating within that framework must lose.
