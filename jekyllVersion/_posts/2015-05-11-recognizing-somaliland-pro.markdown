Internationally recognized. Somilandpress Jan. 18 2012 "Unlike Mogadishu that transitional federal government the US, UK, and much of the international community recognize as the legitimate government of “Somalia”, The republic of Somiland has achieved success without major assistance with foreign nations or UN". Also, Aljazzera Jul. 12 2012 "August 20 2012, the date on which the mandate for the UN-backed transitional government ends."

Somalia has not seen an elected government in more than 20 years, and the International community is running out of patience as the temporary government has been funded for more than 9 years now. Meanwhile, a UN report 2012 says "millions of dollars of taxpayers funds intended for Somalia's Transitional Federal Government have gone missing. It claims that for every $10 received, $7 never made it into state coffers."

Political Stability. Economist Jan. 9 2014 "While its mother nation has been in meltdown, Somalilanders in Hargeisa established a currency, set up a working government, held a series of free elections and saw through a peaceful transfer of power. But after two decades, they still haven’t won recognition as a country from international partners."

Politically Strategic. Christian Science Monitor Jul. 11 2009 "A multiparty democracy with an elected president and parliament, a secular Muslim country with no tolerance for extremism, a thriving free-market economy with precious little foreign aid, and a strict law-and-order state with no patience for piracy – Somaliland is exactly the kind of country the Western world loves to embrace." "We are the key," says Abdillahi Duale, Somaliland's foreign minister, during a recent interview. "This is the only safe haven you've got [in the region]. This is the only government with the public will and muscle to deal with the issue of piracy. With Somaliland, you have the only willing partner."

Very much legal. Somaliland has a strong legal case for recognition because it sticks to old colonial borders favored by the international community. Increased financial security may also support its bid. US and UN has recognize nations that emerged for meltdown mother nations 

Economic Stability. The Somaliland government has handed out a number of oil licences to exploration groups like Genel Energy, an Anglo-Turkish firm, in recent years, and is about to sign the biggest business deal in its 22-year history. An offer worth “hundreds of millions [of dollars]” has been tabled by “one of the world’s best port operators” to develop the harbour at Berbera, according to Jason McCue, a human rights lawyer who works as an envoy on the independence bid.

Serving as a trade route for landlocked Ethiopia, which has annual exports of about $1bn, could strengthen Somaliland’s bid for recognition amongst its neighbours. Big international investors could also influence their home governments to acknowledge Somaliland as a country.
