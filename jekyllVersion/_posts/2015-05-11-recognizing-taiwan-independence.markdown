Jeopardize Taiwanese Chinese relations. Most important segment of the US China Taiwan triangle is the Taiwan China link. David Lampton, Director of China Studies at Johns Hopkins, states that "the only probably place where two nuclear powers could come into major conflict right now is the Taiwan Strait." This is because as a May 18 Article in the Eurasia Review states, “The Chinese consider Taiwan an indispensible piece of territory worth going to war over.” This is the reason no major country up to now has recognized Taiwan. 

Moreover, right now is a terrible time for this legislation because Taiwanese Chinese relations have been steadily improving. On February 11, Representatives of Taiwan and China held their first official talks since 1949, and according to the NYT cross-strait trade is at a record $197 billion. US should give China and Taiwan time to mediate before throwing wrench.

Not even Taiwan is decided on it’s own independence.  According to a February 23 poll mentioned in the Tapei Times, a majority of Taiwanese actually don’t support ultimate independence. This is because, while strongly nationalistic, most Taiwanese recognize China as a major trading power as well as a potential threat if independence is declared. Most Taiwanese prefer the status quo; according to a poll from The National Interest last June, over 90% of Taiwanese favored the unofficial independence Taiwan has right now. 

The US is one of Taiwan’s most important allies, and I want to keep it that way. But right now, unofficial independence is in the best interest of Taiwan as well as the US.
