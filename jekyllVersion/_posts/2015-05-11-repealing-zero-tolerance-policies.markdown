Intro: Zero tolerance rules have become a standing joke -- a reflection of educators' lack of authority, not a useful tool of school order.

Rigid law code. Huffington Post March 21 2014 "Let's start again. Fairness almost always requires context. Unilaterally kissing a girl may be excusable in a kindergartner but not in a high school senior. Brandishing a switchblade is different than accidentally leaving a kitchen knife in the bed of a truck. Making a drawing of a gun is different than bringing a gun. That's why zero tolerance rules are counterproductive, fostering a culture of legal argument instead of being tethered to community norms of right and wrong."

Effect on African American and latino students. Fenning and Rose (2007) Overrepresentation of African American students in exclusionary discipline: The role of school policy. Urban Education "also attribute high rates of school suspension and expulsion rates to racism and bias, specifically institutional racism." Alos, Casella, R. (2003).Zero Tolerance policy in schools: Rationale, consequences, and alternatives. Teachers College Record "Latino and African American students are more likely to suffer the punishments of zero tolerance because of issues of institutional racism previously mentioned. Specifically, Latino and African American students are more likely to live in poverty and reside in dangerous neighborhoods. Consequently, these students are more likely to be punished and are less resilient to the social consequences of suspension and expulsion."

Strike innocence for children. New York times May 23 2012 "Son song I’m sexy and I know to a girl on multiple occasion and was deemed a repeat offender sexual harasser. I'm not excusing my son's behavior," his mother insists. But this is a discipline issue, she says, not a sexual one: "He doesn't even know what it means. Where's the common sense?""

Drug policy versus health concerns. According to a Study conducted by Shawn Malia Kana‘iaupuni, PhD in 2005 "Suspension and expulsion are not effective disciplinary tool for students and do not treat the reasons for substance abuse origins"
