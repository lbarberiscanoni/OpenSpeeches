Language can hurt. The language of oppression does violence to self-esteem, even if the oppressed people do not witness it. Using language or concepts that reflect racism, sexism, or other biases is unacceptable even if nobody in one of the maligned groups is on hand to take offense, for it desensitizes all participants to prejudice. This examination of language must even extend to the words used in the evidence read by the opposing teams in a round of debate. Sensitivity toward people who face discrimination requires that we overlook the arguments presented in the round and punish the side using offensive language with a loss; anything less than that is an endorsement of oppression and bigotry.

Arguments that deal with certain segments of the world population (such as those living in the Middle East, those living in Asia, those described as "terrorists", or those living in "rogue states") could trigger a rhetoric kritik. Of course, failure to provide special mention of any of these groups can also trigger a rhetoric kritik, on the basis of "perpetuating the Western pattern of ignoring disenfranchised peoples." Political correctness being as aggressive as it is, one can build a kritik based on the mere mention of these groups (because mentioning them underscores their "special" status and denies them inclusiveness within the general population), or based on the failure to mention them (because that just reinforces societyï¿½s effort to exclude these people).
