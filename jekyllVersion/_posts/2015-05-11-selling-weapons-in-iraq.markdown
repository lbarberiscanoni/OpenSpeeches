Championships are won with a great defense.

The Pentagon is planning to deliver an array of military systems to help Iraq protect itself from terrorists. The systems include everything from Humvees, to turboprop aircraft. And let us not forget the blimps on steroids.

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency that coordinates arms sales to foreign allies announced Tuesday three separate deals with Iraq, worth a total of $981 million, pending Congressional approval.

SUNNI vs SHITE Conflict = jihadists rooting themselves in both sects. 
Center for Strategic and International  Studies: "Iraq’s politics will continue to present a serious risk of instability for at least the next decade, and violent terrorist groups and other factions will remain a major problem through at least 2015. Key risks like the divisions between Sunni and Shi’ite, and Arab and Kurd, remain critical issues.   So do the many tensions and rivalries between leaders and factions, and the ongoing challenge from violent Sunni and Shi’ite extremists."

Iraq must create armed forces that can both deter and defend the country in dealing with foreign threats, and deal with terrorism and insurgents within a system of proper law. The Center for Strategic and International Studies points out that: "It must create effective manpower plans to deal with the freeze that began in 2009, and which leaves some 250,000 personnel in a force structure intended to have 322,000. In the process, it must decide on the future size of its forces – including both manpower and major equipment, the source of its arms imports, and military training and advice, and how much such efforts will be linked to a strategic partnership with the US or other states."
