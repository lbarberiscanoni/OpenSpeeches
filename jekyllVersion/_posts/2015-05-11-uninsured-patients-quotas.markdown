Hospital can’t realistically turn away patients. Privately-owned hospitals may turn away patients in a non-emergency, but public hospitals cannot refuse care.The Emergency Medical and Treatment Labor Act (EMTLA) "Public and private hospitals alike are prohibited by law from denying a patient care in an emergency. The Emergency Medical and Treatment Labor Act (EMTLA) passed by Congress in 1986 explicitly forbids the denial of care to indigent or uninsured patients based on a lack of ability to pay." Essentially, the law establishes a “treat first, ask questions later” policy.

Doesn’t solve narrow networks. Cancer patients are also waking up to the realities of Obamacare's narrow networks. According to an Associated Press analysis, "only 4 of 19 nationally recognized comprehensive cancer centers offer Obamacare patients access to their facilities through all insurance plans in their state Obamacare exchanges."
