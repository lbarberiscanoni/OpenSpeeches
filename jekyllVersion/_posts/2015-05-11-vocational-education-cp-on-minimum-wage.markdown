Shortcomings of a tiered minimum wage. A tiered minimum wage isn’t some magical policy where everyone comes out ahead.  As Jordan Weismann writes in The Atlantic in January 2014, "the trade-off that comes with a tiered minimum wage is that there are more teens working but fewer jobs for the older workers who need them most."

I propose a better way to tackle Youth Unemployment without harming older Americans. What I’m talking about is vocational education. 

Youth Unemployment is definitely a big problem right now; according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics as of July 2013, "there are 3.8 million unemployed youth in America." Yet at the same time, as Anthony Carnevale, director of Georgetown’s Center on Education and the Workforce, states, "there are over 2 million open jobs in the US skilled manufacturing industry." 

The problem is a mismatch of skills; though fields like manufacturing, utilities, or mining don’t need advanced degrees, they require vocational training. Moreover, due to the retiring baby boomer generation, Carnevale estimates there will be 3 million job openings over the next decade. 

Vocational Education and training connects those unemployed youth to these millions of jobs. According to the National Education Association in March 2012, "High school students have been steadily taking less vocational credits since 1990 even though almost 3/4 of current jobs only require vocational education."   

Moreover, sending otherwise unemployed youth to vocational school directly decreases youth unemployment because these youth are taken out of the labor force. This is actually a main way the Australian government keeps unemployment low; they push people into vocational training, which takes them out of the labor force and prepares them for a future job. 

It’s time for the US to invest in our youth and give them a future beyond a minimum wage job.
