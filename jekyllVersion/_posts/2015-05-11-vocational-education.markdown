Create sub group of individuals that would be cheaper to hire and use thus creating discrimination. McDonnell Douglas Corp v Green "Establishes a protected class". By encouraging businesses to look for youth, you discriminate against older employees. Also, Age Discrimination in Employment Act. O’Connor v Consolidated Coin Caterers ""Ruling determined that individuals hired/fired within the same age bracket such as 40 or older cannot be considered as discrimination. However, an individual 40 years or older being replaced by an individual younger than 40 can fall under the precedent established under McDonnell Douglas Corp v Green."

This type of encouragement would hamper teens from hunting higher education 
According to Forbes on May 19th, 2014 "Today, college graduates can expect to bring in $2.3 million during their lifetimes versus $1.3 million for high school graduates only. In other words, bachelor’s degree holders currently earn 74 percent more over the span of their working years than those with just a high school diploma."" The benefits of a college degree extend beyond earning power, however. College-educated workers also have lower out-of-work levels than their less-educated peers. According to Federal Reserve Economic Data "the unemployment rate in March 2014 for college graduates ages 25 and older was 3.4 percent versus 6.3 percent for those with a high school diploma."
