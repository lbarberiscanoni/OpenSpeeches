1. _This bill violates federalism._ The legislation that many say sets the national drinking age, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, does two things – sets a target purchase and public possession age of 21 and penalises states who do not adhere to this "target" age by reducing their highway funds. Notably, this act _does not_ mandate a federal drinking age – as a matter of fact, it doesn't even actually mandate any kind of drinking age. This is left up to the states to decide if they want a drinking age at all and what exemptions or restrictions can also be placed. The legislation in front of us explicitly forces a drinking age upon the states, which violates states' rights.

1. _This bill does not allow for exemptions._ Current state laws allow for the consumption of alcohol for religious purposes. Furthermore, some states allow the consumption of alcohol by underage drinkers if they are supervised – in their homes with their parents, for example. Because this bill does not define "drinking age" and does not provide any exceptions nor ways to handle exceptions, it is much less viable than the law already in place. If anything, the act should be either rewritten or amended.
