As the great former New Jersey Supreme court justice, Andrew Napolitano put it "Does the Government have the right to force vaccinations, in my view it doesn't because if you're an adult you own your own body and if you are a parent you are the custodian of the body of the child" Today in my speech I will go over 3 points, First, I will go over why this bill is morally wrong then I will go over the problems caused by the generalized wording of the bill and then I will go over why this bill is unconstitutional.

Now do not misunderstand me I do agree that vaccines are beneficial; I believe vaccines for these diseases are some of the greatest scientific and medical breakthroughs in human history but this isn't a debate about whether or not vaccines are beneficial. This is a debate for whether or not the federal government should make vaccines mandatory. Merriam Webster list synonyms to mandatory as compulsory, forced and involuntary are those the qualities we look for, that we strive in our laws we put in place for in our Republic, I do not believe so.

Secondly, this bill would demand every single individual in the United States to be vaccinated, it seems like the simple solution to a large problem but as the FDA in an article titled Vaccines for Children - A Guide for Parents and Caregivers says to alert pediatricians to a history of weak immune systems, so that doctors can administer treatment depending on what is best for their children.

And finally on to my third and final point, which is why proponents of this bill are threats to public safety, the constitution and the American people. Nowhere in the constitution is the government given the right to force something into your body, nor is it given the right to stab the American citizenry with needles. Therefor the right to pass this bill goes to the states as outlined in the 9th and 10th amendment.

To conclude I urge a vote in the negation because this bill has the United States government force their needles into American citizens without their consent, this bill over generalizes a complicated issue and this bill threatens public safety because, similarly to diseases, a growing government is also a threat to public safety.

(growing government is also a threat to public safety)
