Those on the negation think they are helping by regulating the market, the problem is that when you regulate the market you are really regulating people, the market isn't a machine you jumpstart, it's the billions of voluntary exchanges that happen everyday or in other words human action. And as such when you regulate the market you are regulating people.

In my speech I will go over two contentions the first is to promote the free market, and the second the economic benefits of affirming this bill.

It seems ridiculous that a government can forbid one person to trade goods with another person simply because they live across an imaginary line. Yale University put forth a report called Trade does promote peace in 2009 by Havard Hegre from the University of Oslo, John Oneal from University of Alabama and Bruce Russet from Yale said that Commerce promotes peace because violence has substantial costs, whether these are paid prospectively or contemporaneously.

To explain what that means one of my favorite political writers Fredrik Bastiat that quote "When goods do not cross borders soldiers will" and if you looked into the historical background of Sanctions you find 2 things. First, when looking at recent sanctions it does not led to changes political changes and worse yet it leads to Wars, for example when we placed Sanctions on Iran throughout the 1990's it never brought political change, what did happen is wars in the middle east. And when we placed Oil sanctions on Japan in 1941, it led to our involvement in the pacific front of WWII. And since this is a sanction on ourselves who would be the one we'd fight? The answer ourselves

In an article titled "Repealing the export ban: a refined solution to America's crude problem?" by Kerry Yan for the Intercollegiate Finance Journal that as of October 19 2014 US production of Oil has risen by 99.5% since 2008 however the problem Mr. Yan discovered with the expanding market is that the quality of the crude oil is to high for the majority of domestic refineries and since they can't trade internationally with refineries that can there is an artificially low demand and high supply and as such the low amount of refineries that can use the crude oil in the United States get the oil at a low price, while that sounds like a positive it actually hurts our oil production business and lowers the economic investment incentive. So despite the explosive growth in the business the ban on oil exports cripples the advancement of technology and more efficient processes by taking away the resources of the previously mentioned economic investment.

To conclude we should promote the free market which also promotes peace and also would promote advancement in the domestic oil market.
