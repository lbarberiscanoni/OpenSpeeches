This bill does nothing to help the plight of the Somalian people; it helps the current government of the Somalian people which is threatened by terrorists, and because of these reasons it is a waste of money and American resources on a country that will do nothing for us in return for nothing. These reasons are why we must negate senators.

My first contention, the amount of power that power Africa, which is what we would be using to install power in Somalia, is not enough. According to usaid.com the Power Africa organization will produce only 30 thousand megawatts of electricity in sub Saharan Africa. This is such a measly amount when you spread it out over all of the countries that Power Africa reaches. The energy information administration states that an average household uses 12 megawatts of power if we take that number and divide it into the 30 thousand megawatts that power Africa is providing we get 2 thousand 500 houses with power. Now I'm not completely positive senators but I'm pretty sure that there are more than 2 thousand 500 house in Somalia.

My second contention, We the United States a country that promotes democracy worldwide would be supporting a country that's main government is threatened by Islamic terrorists and is widely known to be unstable. Only in 2012 was the Islamic terrorist pushed out of the capital of Somalia in Mogadishu. This government has only been around for 2 years so all of you in the affirmation who claim that it is stable. You are just wrong. BBC reports that the terrorist group of al shabab only withdrew from its last stronghold, the city of Kismayo, in Somalia in 2012 and the only way the Somalians were able to reclaim their city was with the help of the Kenyan government. If the government can't even repel attackers on their own how can they defend the electricity plants that power Africa would be installing? If I was a terrorist organization the first thing I would attack would be the infrastructure, and the Somalians wouldn't be able to defend against said attack.

My third contention. Why are we even helping Somalia in the first place? They have nothing to offer us. Yeah they have oil, but nowhere in the bill does it say they would have to pay us back for installing power. This would be purely from the goodness of our hearts senators. And having good in your heart is alright and all, but honestly right now we are up to our waste in debt so we can just be throwing around money out of the goodness of our hearts and with no written obligation for Somalia to give us oil there is no way we can assume they will make an oil trade agreement with us.

Thank you senators and please negate.
