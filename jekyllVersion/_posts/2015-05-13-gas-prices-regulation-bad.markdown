As the great economist Milton Friedman remarked "underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief and freedom itself"

I stand for freedom and liberty whenever possible but I recognize that gas prices should be higher. However, I stand firmly against this bill because coercing gas prices is not the way to go.

It simply makes no sense to set a price floor to 4 dollars without first eliminating oil subsidies. The international monetary fund finds that the United States government gives upwards of $502 billion a year and subsidies to oil and fuel companies. If we stop subsidizing fuel prices we would save money we can back back to our constituents: after all, we are here to represent them and who is better suited to represent them financially than they themselves?! The people we represent can express their beliefs about energy policy through the free market by economically endorsing the source of the energy their purchase from.

The market is the best way to advance alternative energy. As the International Monetary Fund explains "Energy subsidies hurt the energy industry because with artificially low gas prices reduce the incentive for investment in new energies. Higher gas prices instead open the door to alternative sources of energy, which lends itself to economic growth." If we pass this bill the United States government would be simultaneously lowering and raising fuel prices. When we are artificially raise or lower prices we are covering and not solving the problem, much like a five-year-old stuffing his toys under his bed rather than cleaning up.

When we allow the market to solve openings we open the gates to new ideas new technologies and new markets. There is a way to get all the benefits from the bill without all the negatives for responsibility, and for liberty negate the bill.
