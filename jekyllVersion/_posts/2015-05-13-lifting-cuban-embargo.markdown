Cuba

AFF

The United States embargo with Cuba is much like Senator Regan's marriages: despite litigation and prenups, we our always on the losing end.

In my speech I will go over two points firstly that it hurts our interest and helps the Castros and secondly our constituents should be able to trade with whoever they please.

Our policies hurt the Cuban economy, that's the point, but this doesn't hurt the Castros agter all Fidel Castro is estimated to have net worth is 900 million dollars instead this policy hurts the Cuban people. And the Castros can blame the sanction and therefor the United States for the problems facing their economy and this is also what we see in North Korea. This is one of the main problems with sanctions but so is what happens after sanctions, to quote one of my favorite political writers Fredrik Bastiat "When goods do not cross borders soldiers will" and if you looked into the historical background of Sanctions you find 2 things. First, when looking at recent sanctions it does not led to changes political changes and worse yet it leads to Wars, for example when we placed Sanctions on Iran throughout the 1990's but it never brought political change, what did happen is wars in the middle east. And when we placed Oil sanctions on Japan in 1941, it led to the pacific front of WWII.

I think it is important to understand that Sanctions and Embargoes are Acts of War. Because the only way to enforce that no trade occurs is to block ports off and ports are blocked with Naval Ships. We may not be directly killing anyone but our military is inflicting harm on the local citizenry.

But now to my second point, when I say trade with whoever they please that means Senator Abdeladl that your cigars would finally be legal, but also that our citizens would be allowed to conduct business in Cuba. It seems ridiculous that a government can forbid one person to trade goods with another person simply because they live across an imaginary line. Yale University put forth a report called Trade does promote peace in 2009 by Havard Hegre from the University of Oslo, John Oneal from University of Alabama and Bruce Russet from Yale said that Commerce promotes peace because violence has substantial costs, whether these are paid prospectively or contemporaneously.

To conclude Sanctions dont help American intrest and instead may cause conflict in the future so for peace and freedom please vote in the affirmitive
