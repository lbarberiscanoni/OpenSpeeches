The 10th Amendment:

The Tenth Amendment to the United States' Constitution indicates "...that powers not

granted to the United States were reserved to the States or to the people. It added

nothing to the instrument as originally ratified."

-United States v. Sprague, 282 U.S. 716, 733 (1931).

Conspicuously absent from those powers granted was that of "police power," which is

the authority to regulate the health, safety and morality of a population.

"Interference with the power of the States was no constitutional criterion of the power of

Congress. If the power was not given, Congress could not exercise it; if given, they

might exercise it, although it should interfere with the laws, or even the Constitutions of

the States.''

-2 Annals of Congress 1897

HOWEVER:

''From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not

depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a

granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted end.''

-United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 124 (1941). [This precedent has since been

overturned, so if it comes up, use Lopez (1995) and Morrison (2000) to negate it].

BUT:

In 1995 in United States v. Lopez struck down a statute prohibiting possession of a gun

at or near a school. In doing so, the Supreme Court rejected an argument that

possession of firearms in school zones can be punished under the Commerce Clause

because it impairs the functioning of the national economy. The impact of that being

simply: unless an activity is both (1) economic in nature and (2) can be empirically

shown to have a direct -rather than secondary- impact to interstate commerce, congress

may not claim this to be a viable regulation under the commerce clause (the only

measure by which congress may claim that it is regulating pursuant to a granted power).

As such, the "Bill to Prevent Children's Access to Firearms" necessitates an

unconstitutional overreach of congressional authority (in its enforcement). This principle

was further emphasized in the court's decision in US v. Morrison (2000), which held that

congress may not regulate "non-economic... conduct based solely on that conduct's

aggregate effect on interstate commerce" where congress would have to exercise a

quasi-police power to do so. Says the court "[W]e can think of no better example of the

police power, which the Founders

_denied_

the National Government and reposed in the

States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims."

Regarding the "Bill to Trace the Sale of Firearms," not only is this NOT an act of

regulation,

_but rather one of facilitated recording and oversight_

, it's focus is NOT on

#

regulating economic activity but of **keeping records** and **monitoring** economic activity.

Pursuant to the later holding in Morrison (2000), because MERELY tracing the sale of

firearms is in and of itself not a substantive regulation which has a direct impact on

interstate economic activity, it too is an unconstitutional overreach of congressional

authority at the expense of state's rights in violation of the 10th Amendment.
