Increased taxes leads to smuggling which leads to mobs which leads to violence

Much like the mafia of the 1920's raised the **i** r money through bootlegging and selling of alcohol, raising taxes on cigarettes will create a new opportunity for the mobs to profit. I negate today's bill because the deaths from tobacco not nearly as numerous and tragic as the deaths from organized crime.

Increasing taxes on cigarettes creates a powerful economic incentive to buy and sell cigarettes on the black market. It's already difficult as is for law enforcement to keep up. For example, The Reason Organization reports that "1994, resident of Niagara Falls Ontario could drive across the border to Niagara Falls, New York and buy cigarettes taxed at a mere $.36 a pack at home the same individual have a combined provincial and federal tax rate of 1.54 American dollars. Such behavior was not uncommon, worse smuggling became a major enterprise". This bill only encourages smuggling of cigarettes, and those involved will not be wild American entrepreneurs, but ruthless and violent organized criminal organizations.

This bill incentivizes smuggling, which creates the environment for gangs and mobs to foster and grow from its profits. And with mobs, comes corruption and violence. The United States National Gang Center reports that "between 2007 and 2011 alone, more than 8000 Americans died at the hands of local organized crime." These deaths are already too much, systematically every single time we have enabled an environment that makes smuggling profitable, the Italian Mafia, the Russia Mob, and all sorts of horrible and despicable organizations came into power and ruined our communities. This bill will do this all over America, and I just can't let this happen.
