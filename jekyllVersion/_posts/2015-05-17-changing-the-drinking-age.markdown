Melissa Stegner will never forget Christmas of 2007. It was the year that her father and brother was killed by a drunk driver. The drunk driver was only 19 years old. So for the following reasons I strongly urge you to negate this bill.

First, Drinking leads to more accidents. According to an article from The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on August 2013, In just 2013 alone, 290,000 Americans were injured by drunk driving crashes.And there were 10,076 deaths. And every 52 minutes, someone dies in the US by being hit by a drunk driver. Also According to the CDC, teens that are between 16 and 19, are 3 times more likely to be in a fatal crash. This is without being under the influence. But if we affirmed this bill and allowed 18 year olds to drink, this rate would be higher. And we would not only be allowing the teens to be put in danger but also the innocent drivers on the road that are not under the influence.

Second, The human brain is not fully developed until the age of 25. A recent study led by neuroscientist Susan Tapert of the University of California, compared the brain scans of teens who drink heavily with the scans of teens who don't. Her team found damaged nerve tissue in the brains of the teens who drank. In other words, key areas of the brain are still under construction during the adolescent years, and are more sensitive to the toxic effects of drugs and alcohol. Drinking affects 2 main parts of the brain: the Hippocampus and the Frontal Lobe. According to National Health and Medical Research Council, the Hippocampus is responsible for memory and learning. Studies of adolescents show that heavy and extended alcohol use is associated with a 10% reduction in the size of the hippocampus. It also shows that the function of the hippocampus is uniquely sensitive to alcohol at this time and that alcohol may be poisonous to the nerve cells of the hippocampus causing them to be damaged or destroyed.The prefrontal lobe is important for planning, judgement, decision making, impulse control and language.This area of the brain changes the most during the teenage years. Research with heavy drinking adolescents' shows that these young people have smaller prefrontal lobes than young people of the same age who do not drink.

So for the following reasons, 1. Drinking leads to more accidents and 2. The human brain is not fully developed until the age of 25.I strongly urge you to negate this bill. Thank you.
