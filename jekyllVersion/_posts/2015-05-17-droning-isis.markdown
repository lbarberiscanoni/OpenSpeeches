ISIS, or also known as Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is a threat to America and other countries. So for the following reasons I strongly urge you to affirm this bill.

First, ISIS has killed American citizens so it is the responsibility of our government to protect our citizens so if our citizens in the middle east are threatened, we need to protect them. According to an article from CNN, on September 15, 2014, ISIS is believed to be holding a number of Americans. CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen reports that ISIS is understood to be holding [at least two other American citizens](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/14/opinion/bergen-british-connection-isis-beheadings/index.html), as well as hostages from additional Western countries. ISIS has been holding numerous amounts of Americans and even killing many.

Second, We need to get ISIS under control before they do more harm than good. According to an article from Win.Without.War from September 10, 2014, we can get ISIS under control many different ways. For example, we could, as we say it, hit it where it hurts. known as the wallet. One of ISIS's main strengths is its unprecedented access to financial resources. All this money allows it to recruit fighters, purchase weapons, and buy the support of local populations.While some of this financing comes from [donors](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/14/america-s-allies-are-funding-isis.html), much of it comes from [smuggling illegal oil](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-hoh/bda-genocide-and-oil-in-i_b_5731906.html) from fields it controls in Iraq and Syria. Ultimately, these fields will need to be retaken by [local forces](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-28/kurds-recapture-iraq-oil-fields-advance-on-rebel-held-towns.html) but, as we have seen in Afghanistan with our efforts to cut off the Taliban. Cracking down on Turkish, Iraqi, and other oil dealers who are purchasing the oil on the [black market](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/14/opinion/disrupt-isiss-cash-flow-in-iraq.html) would cut ISIS off from one of its most important revenue streams. We could also Crack down on ISIS's supply routes and weapons supply. The same article states, Today, ISIS enjoys something essential to any effective insurgency: the ability to resupply itself. While we often hear about the ability to move supplies between Iraq and Syria, the reality is that ISIS is surrounded on all sides by enemies who can and should do more to cut off its supply routes from the outside. A primary culprit is [Turkey](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/04/turkey-syria-borders-smuggling-guns-conflict-kurds-pkk-isis.html), whom America should force to crack down on the flow of fighters and weapons across its border with Syria. If we get ISIS under control, it will not only benefit the US but also other countries.

If we were to authorize airstrikes on the members of ISIS's "kill list" it would not only help the US citizens but all the countries surrounding it.And so for the following reasons, 1. They have harmed American citizens so it's our responsibility to help. 2. We need to get ISIS under control before they do more harm than good, I strongly urge you to negate this bill.
