I have no desire to try to become an Olympic pole-vaulter, but I like having the option. Similarly private, charter and governor schools may chose to or not to judge an applicant for admission, but taking away that information and option to do so isn't helpful.

Today in my speech I will go over the main reason why you should negate this legislation and that is that these schools should be able to make the decision of who is best for their institution on a case-by-case bases and not a singular central plan.

The affirmative says that Standard tests, such as the Independent School Entrance Exam and the Secondary School Admission tests, narrow the amount of information the student needs to know, but sometimes that's the goal for example for Trade schools, which Merriam Webster defines as a secondary school teaching the skilled trades, would not be able to use standardized tests since they are secondary schools and the bill outlaws them from doing that and no longer be able to use standard tests that measure the information they are trying to ascertain and cripple their ability to measure students fairly.

The reason schools would decide to accept standardized tests is because they are trying to get the best students they can, if the affirmative is correct and standardized tests are not accurate than a school who looks at other information as more important benefit from that policy. And so what we see is that there is natural consequences for both the correct and the wrong choice. Regardless this bill would disallow schools
