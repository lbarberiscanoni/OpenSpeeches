Introduction:

With the amount of oil my face produces, I'm surprised the US hasn't made an alliance with it. That being said, the US has developed a stereotype for being extremely dependent on oil from foreign countries. And this stereotype is completely true. This is why I must negate this bill. I will negate this bill for two reasons: The lifting of the ban on exporting crude oil won't reduce our dependency Saudi Arabia and other countries, and this bill strains relationships with these countries.

Point 1:

While the exportation of crude oil may dilute the market and slightly decrease gas prices, increased crude oil production won't decrease our dependency on foreign oil at all. According to Forbes, there are many types of crude oil. Some is heavy, some is light. Some is "sour", containing a large sulfur content, and some is "sweet". The oil supplied mostly by American drilling is light and easy to refine. However, most oil refineries in the US have spent tens of billions of dollars investing in high quality refining equipment to process heavy, sour crude oil from other countries. Since they already invested so much capital optimizing plants for heavy crudes, they can't just turn around and process light American oil. Even factoring in transportation costs, it makes more sense economically for them to use import heavy oils from other countries.

Point 2:

In a paper published by Ã–zgenur Korlu on academia.edu, It is concluded that increased production of crude oil in the United States will strain relationships with oil exporting countries, namely Saudi Arabia. Look at it like this, a Walmart has been open in a town for a long time. Then, a new smaller store opens with cheaper prices than Walmart. Sadly, this cheaper store doesn't offer everything that people need, but Walmart is still going to view this new store as harsh competition. Saudi Arabia is like the Walmart and America is like the smaller store.

Conclusion

So, If exporting more crude oil doesn't reduce our dependency on other countries, and it strains relationships with these same countries, then we are putting our constituents in a situation where we could not have a supply of oil. And since the U.S. cannot be self sufficient in oil, this is an option we can't take.

U.S. Oil exports: 1.6 million barrels, Imports: 13 million barrels, Exports of refined gas not illegal, We make a nominal amount of money from exporting according to Forbes
