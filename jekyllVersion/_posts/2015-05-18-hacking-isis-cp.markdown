Intro:

A beheading doesn't sound like it would be a very popular video online. Yet the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria is spreading their horrible message mainly through social media. In reaction to the cruel images, many are saying we should authorize airstrikes on the state. However, this is not the most effective or efficient way to deal with these terrorists. I propose that we wage a cyber war against ISIS. Firstly, I will elaborate on my plan, and secondly I will explain why it is more effective than airstrikes.

Plan:

I propose we use hacking to destroy ISIS social media accounts, cut off propaganda videos, try to gain intelligence into ISIS, and overall try to damage ISIS by means of cyber warfare. This plan of action shall be carried out instead of authorizing airstrikes. The U.S. Army Cyber Command shall carry out this plan.

Why it is more effective:

Cyber warfare is more effective than authorizing airstrikes for numerous reasons. Firstly it has already worked on the small scale. Anonymous, a hacking group, has reportedly taken down 9,200 of ISIS social media accounts. As a direct result, ISIS has put Anonymous hackers at the top of their most wanted list. This means that cyberspace is extremely important to ISIS, a weak spot, and for good reason, too. The recent hack on Sony cost the company $150 million according to The Guardian. In addition, the cost of waging cyber warfare is significantly lower than that of carrying out airstrikes. The International Business Times stated that airstrikes on ISIS will cost around $10 billion per year. The University of Dayton estimates a full fledge cyber war will cost the U.S. Government around $3.2 billion, which is around 34-35% the cost of airstrikes. This huge price gap makes it reasonable to consider waging a cyber war.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, we should carry out this plan because it is already proven effective and is significantly cheaper than the cost of airstrikes.
