Intro:

In 2013, a total of 200 children 14 or younger were killed in alcohol impaired driving crashes from people aged 21 to 24. That's the equivalent of 10 Sandy Hook school shootings. And now, people are proposing that we decrease the minimum drinking age. I must negate this bill for the following two reasons: MLDA 21 saves lives, and alcohol can affect the overall health of underage people.

Point 1: 21 Saves Lives

Firstly, A meta-study conducted by the Journal of Studies on Alcohol found a higher legal drinking age directly correlates to a lower rate of traffic accidents.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimated that MLDA 21 decreased the number of fatal traffic accidents for 18- to 20-year-olds by 13% and saved approximately 27,052 lives from 1975-2012. There are more than 25,000 people who are on this Earth because of MLDA 21. In addition, the Institute of Medicine National Research Council stated that teen alcohol use kills 4,700 people per year. Which leads me to my next point.

Point 2: Alcohol can affect the overall health of underage people

The teens presented in that statistic are able to acquire alcohol despite MLDA 21 because newly legal drinkers often purchase alcohol for their underage peers, creating a "trickle-down" effect.  According to the Alcohol Epidemiology Program at the University of Minnesota, the most common source of alcohol among 18- to 20-year olds is their 21- to 24-year-old peers. Reducing the legal drinking age could lead to even younger people drinking alcohol due to this "trickle down" effect. In addition, a study from the _Journal_ _of Studies of Alcohol and Drugs_ found that the younger a person begins to drink alcohol, the more likely it is that they will use other drugs. Thus, Lowering MLDA 21 would increase the number of underage teens who drink and use illegal drugs. The negative effects of alcohol and drug addiction include reduced immune response, paranoia, and liver damage just to name a few. This is how reducing the drinking age would negatively impact the health of underage people. People who drink alcohol once aren't all going to get addicted. I never stated they were all going to get addicted as soon as they took a sip. But if we he have more people taking that sip, than we also have more people getting addicted. It's simple probability.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, reducing the minimum drinking age would lead to more deaths, and more substance addiction for underage teens. This is why we must negate this bill.
