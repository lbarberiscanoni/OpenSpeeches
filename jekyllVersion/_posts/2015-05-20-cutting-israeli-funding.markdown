"What a cruel thing war is... to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbors." â€“Robert E Lee said that, and there is some irony in that, but he explains an overarching truth. War is bad, and our support of Israel encourages Israel and spurns Hamas to action, I stand Affirmation of todays legislation cut foreign aid to Israel in order to avoid problems in the future and will then go over this bill would entail.

First, to avoid problems in the future, according to the Jerusalem post former US Gen. David Petraeus said on March 16 2010 that US involvement in the Arab-Israeli conflict hurts America's ability to advance its interests in the Middle East, fomenting anti-American sentiment and limiting America's strategic partnership.

Actions have consequences and this bill will have a cause and effect. The Arab Countries that surround Israel do not like Israel, so when the US unilaterally and unfairly funds Israel those Arab Countries extend their dislike to us.

So unilaterally funding Israel puts the United States itself in danger.

Secondly According to Business Insider we give more than 3 billion dollars annually to Israel. This bill cuts the amount and limits the amount of resources we are provinding. And as such we must affirm because it is irresponsible of us as representatives to continue unilaterally providing support which hurts our interests in the region, at least with this bill it equates the amount given. We should promote peace and trade, in that region and not war and destruction. This bill would help build infrastructure and better infrastructure results in a stronger economy A report by the Thomas Jefferson program in Public Policy from the College of William and Mary titled "The Economic Impact and Financing of Infrastructure Spending" found that quote "Over a twenty-year period, generalized 'public investment' generates an accumulated $3.21 of economic activity per $1.00 spent."

Stronger economies equate to trade and peace. French philosopher Frederic Bastiat claimed "if goods don't cross borders, soldiers will."Bastiat argued that trade between countries could reduce international conflict because trade forges connections between nations and gives each country an incentive to avoid war with its trading partners. If we can strengthen the economy of philistine it would incentive trade between Israel and Philistine. Also applying the principle of the Marshall Plan, that prosporous economies won't want to go to war, and we would therefore be stabilizing the region.

So to conclude United Sates funding of Israel hurts United States interest and destabilizes the region and stand with me to promote peace and stability by affirming todays legislation. Thank you.
