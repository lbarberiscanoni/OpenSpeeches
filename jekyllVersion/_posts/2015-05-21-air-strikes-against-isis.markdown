ISIS the something something of Iraq and Syria see that's the problem senators most of us don't know or understand ISIS. This is why we don't realize that if we affirm this bill nothing will happen. We also would be enabling the President after he has stepped out of line and technically be giving him permission to drop soldiers from the sky into ISIS territory.

ISIS is a group of Sunni Muslims which is a rival sect to the wider known group of Muslims known as Shiites. This means that for them they are fighting for their religion which makes them a very passionate group of people and if we were to kill them others would only take their place and their fallen comrades would become martyrs. Jesus Christ is one of the greatest examples of all for this type of situation. Romans killed him because they saw him as a threat and in a matter of years Christianity swept the region and the main religion of Rome became Christianity. Therefore creating martyrs is not what we should be doing.

My second contention, if we affirm this bill we would be laying down while the President tramples all over us and rewarding him for his actions. The president has been authorizing drone strikes without the permission of congress. CNN on August 9th of 2014 reported that Obama had started the drone strikes. That means that Obama has been committing acts of war for 6 months. It says in the constitution that the president can take preemptive action but only for 30 days before getting permission from congress. Therefore since 5 months ago the President has been violating the constitution. CNN on February 12 of 2015 he also violated the constitution by declaring war on ISIS during a television announcement which he has no authority to do. Instead of enabling him by affirming this bill we must lay our foot down negate this bill. If we don't we are opening ourselves up for future acts like this that violate the separation of powers that we hold so dearly.

My third contention, the definition of airstrike according to Webster dictionary is an attack made by air. Also according to Webster dictionary the definition of attack is to take aggressive action against using weapons or armed forces. Therefore because of this bills poor phrasing we would be giving Obama the permission to drop armed forces into ISIS controlled territory which is practically giving the power of a Roman dictator to the president.

So because ISIS leaders will just be replaced and hailed as martyrs and we are giving to much power to the President we must negate.
