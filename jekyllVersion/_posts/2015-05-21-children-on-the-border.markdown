Senators we need to negate this bill for two reasons, first we have already tried with no success, and second this isn't a problem for the United States government.

My first contention, we have already tried to resolve this issue and it hasn't worked. In 2012 President Barrack Obama presented the issue of children migrating alone. Congress agreed to give 1.4 billion dollars to the Federal Emergency management agency. Yet in 2014 the US customs and border protection reported that over 53,000 un attended children were apprehended trying to cross the border. So obviously the money isn't helping the problem. So what is 5 million dollars going to do. All we are doing is very slightly improving the conditions these kids are put into and we shouldn't even be doing that. If we improve the conditions for these children they might see it as an incentive to migrate illegally which create a bigger problem for us.

My second contention, this isn't a problem for the United States. Though it is sad that the conditions in these kids countries are horrible it simply doesn't concern us. If we are to solve this problem as a whole the conditions in the home countries of these children need to be improved and the United States can't improve these countries for them. Improving the system in which we return these children to their countries is only a temporary solution. We are not actually fixing the base problem which is the condition in these childrens countries. And we aren't fixing this problem simply because we can't. So because this solution will only last us little amount of time and because this isn't a concern of the US please negate thank you senators.
