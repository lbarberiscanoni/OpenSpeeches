Cluster munitions are a cruel and in humane method of waging war and that is why we must affirm senators.

My first contention. 100 of other countries have adopted the ban on cluster munitions but the united states still refuses. I speculate that this is because the U.S. is a large cluster munition manufacturer and if they would have adopted the ban it would have cost us a lot of money. Foreign Policy.com reported that the united states recently sold 640 million dollars' worth of cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia despite the rest of the worlds revulsion at such weapons and the reputation of the weapons created by Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad who is known to have murdered children with these weapons. In 2008 the UN even proposed a worldwide ban to these cluster munitions but the US refused to sign with the support of other cluster munition manufacturers like Russia, China, and Israel. We as a country are neglecting the out cry from the rest of the world for our own financial benefit and this is wrong.

My second contention. The Geneva convention already bans weapons that resemble cluster munitions on a smaller level and the US is ignoring this on the grounds of technicalities. The Geneva convention bans a weapon known as flechette rounds. These rounds are fired from artillery cannons and split in midair into tiny needles that explode. This is much like cluster munitions that are not banned by the US even though you can barely differentiate between the two. How can we can we look down on Israel for using flechette rounds during the Ghaza strip bombardment when we continue to sell and manufacture weapons just like them.(btselem.org)

My third contention. Cluster munitions kill innocent people. The UN reported that cluster munitions affect over 20 countries across the world. Because of their defectiveness they sometimes don't detonate on impact and stay embedded in the ground. This cause unnecessary suffering for people in these countries when their family members are randomly put in harms way because of these dangerous munitions. The clearing of these munitions also costs a lot of money and wastes these war torn governments precious resources.

For all these reasons please affirm.
