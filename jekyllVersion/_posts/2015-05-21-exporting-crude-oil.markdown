_Companies have already found a way to get their light oil out of the US._ At least five are developing simple refining projects along the Gulf Coast to process light, sweet crude just enough to create petroleum products that can be freely exported to foreign refiners. "It's not a sleight of hand," says Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. "When you have a ban or restrictions, you get opportunity and improvisation."

_Exporting our crude oil would burn through our oil even faster._ Petroleum geologist Art Berman says, the U.S. experience with fracking shale is "more of a retirement party than a revolution." We have burned through the big, accumulated reservoirs of oil, and now we're getting into the shale below them, or what geologists call the "source rocks" that created the oil. Once we get to the point where we can't produce oil and gas profitably from shale, we're done. The real question for the United States is not about optimal trade policy or economic theory, but whether we want to extract the last drops of our oil endowment as quickly as possible by enabling the debt-fueled land rush that has brought us a gratifying, but temporary, bump in production, or whether we want to make it last as long as possible, knowing that two or three decades from now the world will be absolutely desperate for the stuff, with scarce exports and unimaginably high prices. Good, transparent data analysis by Canadian geologist David Hughes of U.S. tight oil production suggests that it will peak around 2016. The latest projection from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) sees tight oil peaking by 2021. Either way, within a decade we'll be right back to competing with the rest of the world for the dregs. Even if the U.S. could ramp up production to the "energy independence" rate, it would simply cut the lifespan of our remaining oil in half.
