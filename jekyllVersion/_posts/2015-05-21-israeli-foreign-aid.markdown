During World War 2 the u.s. was following a policy of isolation. After Pearl Harbor was bombed the U.s. was forced to join World war 2. I think by voting in negation for this bill we can prevent a similar outcome. During the war there was a total of 1,076,245 American dead or wounded. Imagine if Japan had not forced the U.s. into world war 2. Unfortunately at the time the U.s. didn't have a choice. Today however the U.s. can choose to save thousands of American lives and dollars by standing in negation for the bill to send help to Israel.

This conflict has no end in sight. The conflict started in 1946 when the Palestinian land was handed to the Israelis and has been raging ever since. Even after the Yom Kippur War's UN. Established ceasefire on October 25 1973 the conflict has continued to rage on. What makes the U.S. a single country any better than the UN?

Sending US resources means dumping money into a conflict that has no end in sight.

Also sending resources to Islam will have no effect on the conflict. Maybe the resources help Israel suppress the Palestinians but what is to say they don't reemerge after several years.

After the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in retaliation to the 9/11 attacks we successfully destroyed the Taliban regime but not 3 years later another terrorist organization has risen ISIS. What is to say that Hamas and Israel is a different story. If Israel uses our resources to destroy Hamas what if another terrorist group shows up in the next few years

It is a pointless endeavor and that's why I ask you all to vote in the negation.
