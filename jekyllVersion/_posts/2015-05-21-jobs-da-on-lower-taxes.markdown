_Lowering the corporate tax rate raises the deficit._ Lowering the federal corporate tax rate reduces the amount of money the US government receives in tax revenue, thus reducing federal government programs, investments, and job-creating opportunities. When the Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the top marginal rate from 46% to 34%, the federal deficit increased from $149.7 billion to $255 billion from 1987-1993, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics.

_Lowered tax rates have resulted in companies cutting jobs._ Kristina Peterson of the Wall Street Journal tells us that in 2004, Congress passed a repatriation tax holiday that allowed companies to bring back profits earned abroad at a 5% income tax rate instead of the top 35% rate. Fifteen of the companies that benefited the most from the tax holiday subsequently cut more than 20,000 net jobs.

_High corporate tax rates are a major cause of outsourcing._ Becky Yerak of the Chicago Tribune tells us that the United States is tied for the second highest top-bracket federal corporate income tax rate in the world behind Antigua & Barbuda and Congo (and is the highest in the OECD), and it has a higher "effective" corporate tax rate (27.6%) than 164 out of 183 other countries. [2] These high tax rates force American companies to relocate their employees overseas. For example, Aon, a company with $11.28 billion in 2011 revenue that moved its headquarters from Chicago to London in 2012, said the move would reduce its tax rate by five percentage points, increase its profits by about $100 million annually, and allow them to expand by hiring more employees.

_Outsourcing helps improve conditions in impoverished countries._ According to the Guardian of June 2013, at Telus International, three community boards, located in the Philippines, El Salvador and Guatemala, distribute $100,000 annually each to local grassroots charitable organisations. The boards are run by local community leaders, as well as Telus team members and it's local community leaders, not Telus International, who determine where funds will be most impactful in the community. Most importantly, by creating thousands of well-paid jobs, outsourcing companies are stabilising communities and transforming societies in developing countries. "I think Telus understands sustainability and solidarity," said Tony Meloto, Founder of Gawad Kalinga. "It's about building a permanent impact â€“ schools, water systems and toilets have an impact, not just on the health, and the body, but on the soul."
