_Decrease weaker cases in court._ If the plaintiff must pay the defendants' legal fees in case of a lose, companies would be wary of bringing cases to court and would make sure their cases were strong before bringing any patent-related lawsuit to a court. This effect has been shown by other attempts to institute the "English system", as this system is known. According to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, between 1980 and 1985, Florida adopted a loser-pays rule that applied exclusively to medical-malpractice. This rule seems to have worked to weed out weaker cases and facilitate case disposition: the rate at which medical-malpractice lawsuits were dropped after initial discovery rose from 44 percent to 54 percent of all such filings, and the percentage that proceeded to trial (instead of being dropped or settled) was half of what it had been under the American rule.

_Protect small companies._ Smaller companies who are bullied by big ones with regard to patents won't have to choose between settling out of court and paying high legal fees even if they do win a case. The status quo harms small companies if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought against them no matter what actually happens in court. A survey conducted last year by the American Intellectual Property Law Association to find median litigation costs for patent infringement suits produced jaw-dropping (at least for a startup) numbers: For a claim that could be worth less than a $1 million, median legal costs are $650,000. When $1 million to $25 million is considered "at risk," total litigation costs can hit $2.5 million. For a claim over $25 million, median legal costs are $5 million.
