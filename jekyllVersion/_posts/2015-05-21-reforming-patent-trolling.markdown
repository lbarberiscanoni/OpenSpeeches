_This bill would harm small companies seeking reparations from big companies._ While those on the aff say that the current system harms small businesses, if we pass this legislation, it would also harm small businesses whose patents have been violated by large companies. If these small businesses brought cases to court, lost, and were forced to pay both the damages and the defendants' legal fees as stated in the legislation, these businesses could potentially be ruined. For example, according to Bloomberg Business on February 25, 2015, Apple lost a patent-infringement case to a small startup, Smartflash LLC, and ultimately lost 532.9 million dollars. However, if Smartflash had lost the case, not only would they have basically given up the patent, but also have to pay for Apple's fees. Because of this, this bill discourages small companies from seeking reparations for patent infringement.
