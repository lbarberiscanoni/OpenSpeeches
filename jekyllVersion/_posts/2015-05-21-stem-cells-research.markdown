I think stem cells are the next step in medicine, but this bill must be negated for really 2 reasons. The funding is flawed and so is the method of funding. I will present a counterplan to fix these two problems at the end of my speech that is hopefully better than the bill itself.

My first contention, the bill itself presents a sum of 20 billion dollars to be put into stem cell research and I am here to tell you representatives that this is exponentially too much. The national institute for health reported that in 2013 the grand sum of all money put into the research of stem cells was around 500 million dollars. That's all, 500 million. 500 million is the ever so tiniest fraction of 20 billion. It is just irrational and irresponsible to pour 20 billion dollars into something that doesn't need it. Since the beginning of the 21st century we have made great leaps in stem cell research and the highest the funding ever got was 500 million.

My second contention, The bill, instead of giving a legitimate resource from which we could obtain this 20 billion dollars just says it will come from federal grants. Most bills that come through this congressional chamber usually have a funding mechanism. Usually this funding usually comes through taking funding from another department of the government like the department of defense, the cdc or the irs but this bill simply says federal grants. Federal grants are economic aid issued by the United States government out of the general federal revenue. The general federal revenue is the money that the United States makes from taxes. Since this bill doesn't specify where these federal grants would be coming from we can only assume that they would be new federal taxes to raise the 20 billion. We simply can't increase taxes to raise 20 billion dollars that we don't even need.

For my third contention I would like to present a counterplan. Instead of granting 20 billion dollars to the research of stem cells I would like to lower that to 2 billion. Instead of getting this money from the general federal revenue we would reroute money from the National Health institute for the reason of wasting money on what the Wallstreetjournal reports as experiments on the sexual habits of drunken monkeys.

So because there is too much funding, the funding is coming from the wrong place, and there are better ways to go about the issue please negate.
