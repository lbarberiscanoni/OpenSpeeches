Recently Texas Representative Ron Paul retired from the political scene and his presence will be missed. In 2009, before ISIS was prevalent, Ron Paul gave a speech which he asked "What if our foreign policy of the past century is deeply flawed and has not served our national security interests?

What if we wake up one day and realize that the terrorist threat is a predictable consequence of our meddling in the affairs of others and has nothing to do with us being free and prosperous?

What if propping up repressive regimes in the Middle East endangers both the United States and Israel?"

In my speech I will go over how this war is the same as our failed policies have been in the past, how it only causes cultural recidivism and persistant terrorism and how the real problems faced in Iraq and Syria are not an individual terrorist group but rather basic problems that troops coercion and drone strikes cant solve.

In order to face this problem we need to understand WHY? Why does ISIS exist in the first place and how is it spreading. A Forbes article from June 16, 2014 explains that the issue in Iraq and Syria stems back to 100 years ago when the borders of each country were drawn from the Ottoman Empire. The article reports that the population of the Ottoman Empire was 75% tribal with quote "no history of obedience to central government" as such the boundaries drawn by the British Empire do not reflect the cultures in the area. ISIS is a response by caused by a majority of Sunni's being oppressed in Shiiate owned Northern Iraq and so ISIS is seen as liberaters in North Iraq, If ISIS spreads south the population of Iraq transitions into Shiates that would defend their terroritory, if ISIS goes east to quote Loren Thompson the Chief Operating officer of the Lexington Institute they will be "Mauled" by the Kurdish Peshmarga. ISIS cannot spread much more than it already has. SO now that we understand what the problems in that region of the world are we can see that this bill doesn't solve the underlying problems faced.

And as such instead of propping up the Governments of Iraq and Syria we should let that region face their issue. The Governments should be allowed to fall. When the United States supports these governments the cultures in the area that do not support Iraq or Syria see us as oppressors and that is why they attack us and that is why the United States is at risk from terrorism. We have been trying to fix the problems caused by the boundaries for decades the [Gulf War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War), [Iran–Contra affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair), [Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War), [2003 invasion of Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq), or the [War in Afghanistan (2001–present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)), it hasn't worked and it won't work.

We must Negate this bill because War will not solve our problem, historically our involvement has only caused this problem to persist, the only way to solve this problem is through diplomacy and self-determination.
