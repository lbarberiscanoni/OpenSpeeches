For some of you its probably hard to imagine torture worse than this chamber, but for scores of people across the world a senate chamber is by far less painful than other activities done by the United States.

In my speech today I will go over why the use of enhanced interigation is detrimental to the United States and then I will explain how the United States can be more effective in its activies.

Despite President Obama's executive order 13491 enhanced Interigation is still occurring by the United States Government and perhaps it is because President Obama has failed to carry through on another one of his promises closing Guantonimo Bay, which is the epicenter of the socalled enhanced interigation technique, and it is generally accepted that despite its unconstitutionality its seen as a necessary policy to protect the United States. However this is false, the United States was built on protecting life liberty property and the pursuit of happiness, when we forsake our principles then whats the point of protecting the United States? When the Federal Government has the power to indefinitely detain people and carry enhanced interigation what is the point of protecting Americans?

To further prove my point that we must affirm today's legislation According to a December 11th , 2014 article from the International Business Times written by Conner Sheets Poland is home to a United States CIA black site known as "Quartz." Which has been confirmed by the Former Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski in December of 2014. I want to reiterate this, the United States is torturing people in Poland, if our country continues this tyrannical nazi-like policy.

Just so we can all be clear enhanced interigation is immoral, but furthermore it is unconstitutional. The 5th amendment reads No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury… nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. It reads no person, it doesn't read no American therefore it is clearly unconstitutional to continue the detention of anyone without charging them with a crime and going through due process. And since Guantanamo and other detainees in similar prisons are not given trials it is illegal to deprive them of their rights.

In conclusion Enhanced interigation is immoral and illegal and it hurt the US's reputation is that of one which was founded on principles and idealistic goals, we have fallen short, but the day we fail to strive for them, is the day I will resign.
