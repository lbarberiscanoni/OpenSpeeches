Real life is not like pokemon because in real life badges do not grant extra rights, however I will not vote in the affirmative for this bill because this bill as written does not solve the problem.

In my speech I will simultaneously analyze this bill and explain why this bill is not comprehensive. For two main reasons first of all it does not mandate that the camera's must be on and the second point is that the video gained from the body cameras would be stored in a police database, which means there is no guarantee the video would ever be released.

First of all this bill would require Police Officers to wear a body camera, which is a good idea a body camera would make it so that there is direct evidence of what happens in police incidents. However body camera's do not help when they are turned off whether its in St Louis, which CNN reported on February 18 2015, or New Orleans August 14, 2014 as reported by FOX New Orleans. In both incidents the police officers camera were turned off, so while at first it sounds like I am being nitpicky in reality police turning off their cameras is a serious occurrence and our laws need to explicitly state that turning them off is not allowe. So while this bill is intended to relieve the trust we have to have in police officers this bill actually requires us to trust that police officers keep their camera's on, without explicitly stated repurcussions otherwise.

But on to my second point Washington Post reported on August 19, 2014 that "Officers wearing the cameras were present at at least two shootings earlier this year. Yet we're still not any closer to knowing what happened in those chaotic moments â€” whether the perpetrators can be easily identified, what kind of interactions the officers had with those present, nothing. That's because the department claims the footage" This bill explicitly states that the video will be uploaded to a central database in the police station. In other words the video will be still owned by the police and therefor in practice serves zero value since there is no way to guarantee that the public will ever be able to see it.

For Example the same Washington Post Article also reports that "when Ferguson cops beat Henry Davis after mistakenly arresting him in 2009, a jailhouse camera was supposed to be recording the area where he was beaten. Somehow, the footage of the incident was destroyed." There are countless examples were dashcams and body cameras were turned off or supposedly malfunctioned.

In summation this bill while requiring body cameras say nothing about requiring them to be on and when camera's aren't on they aren't worth anything. Vote in the negation until we have a comprehensive bill.
