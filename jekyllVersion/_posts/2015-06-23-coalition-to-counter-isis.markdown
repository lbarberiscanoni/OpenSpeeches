Recently Texas Representative Ron Paul retired from the political scene and his presence will be missed. In 2009, before ISIS was prevalent, Ron Paul gave a speech which he asked "What if our foreign policy of the past century is deeply flawed and has not served our national security interests?

What if we wake up one day and realize that the terrorist threat is a predictable consequence of our meddling in the affairs of others and has nothing to do with us being free and prosperous?

What if propping up repressive regimes in the Middle East endangers both the United States and Israel?"

In my speech I will go over how this war is the same as our failed policies have been in the past, how it only causes cultural recidivism and persistant terrorism and how the real problems faced in Iraq and Syria are not an individual terrorist group but rather basic problems that drone strikes wont solve. But first things first Section 2 subsection b of the bill calls for military attacks against ISIS, the Oxford dictionary defines war as a state of armed conflict between different nations or states or different groups within a nation or state" so lets not pretend this isn't a war.

We have been trying to form allies in the middle east as long as I can remember, in the early 1990s George HW Bush formed a coalition of 39 countries for the Persian Gulf war, which sounds good but the region hasn't progressed any since and I believe our involvement has only made things worse.

The problem that regionnfaces A Forbes article from June 16, 2014 explained is that the issue in Iraq and Syria stems back to 100 years ago when the borders of each country were drawn from the Ottoman Empire. The article reports that the population of the Ottoman Empire was 75% tribal with quote "no history of obedience to central government" as such the boundaries drawn by the British Empire do not reflect the cultures in the area. ISIS is a response by caused by a majority of Sunni's being oppressed in Shiiate owned Northern Iraq and so ISIS is seen as liberaters in North Iraq, If ISIS spreads south the population of Iraq transitions into Shiates that would defend their terroritory, if ISIS goes east to quote Loren Thompson the Chief Operating officer of the Lexington Institute they will be "Mauled" by the Kurdish Peshmarga. ISIS cannot spread much more than it already has. SO now that we understand what the problems in that region of the world are we can see that this bill doesn't solve the underlying problems faced. SO instead of propping up the Governments of Iraq and Syria we should let that region face their issue. The Governments should be allowed to fall. The United States has been guilty of supporting these governments in the past and that is why ISIS sees us as oppressors as well.

We must Negate this bill because War will not solve our problem
