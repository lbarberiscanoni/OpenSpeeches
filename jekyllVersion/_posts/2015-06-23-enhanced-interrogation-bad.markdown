For some of you its probably hard to imagine torture worse than this chamber, but for scores of people across the world a senate chamber is by far less painful than other activities done by the United States.

In my speech today I will go over why the use of enhanced interigation is unconstitutional and I will explain that even beyond breaking our legal code it also breaks the American moral code that we have fought for and it goes against the principles that Americans have died over.

Firstly its constitutionality, The 5th amendment reads No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury… nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. " It reads no person, it doesn't read no American therefore it is clearly unconstitutional to continue the detention of anyone regardless of their citizenship without without charging them with a crime and going through due process. And since detainees in CIA black sites and secret prisons are not given trials it is illegal to deprive them of their rights.

So it is self evident that enhanced interigation is unconstitutional but despite this too many people believe it is necessary to defend and protect the United States. However that belief is flawed, the United States was built on protecting life liberty property and the pursuit of happiness, when we forsake our principles then whats the point of protecting the United States? When the Federal Government has the power to indefinitely detain people and carry enhanced interigation what is worth defending?

To further prove my point that we must affirm today's legislation According to a December 11th , 2014 article from the International Business Times written by Conner Sheets Poland is home to a United States CIA black site known as "Quartz." Which has been confirmed by the Former Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski in December of 2014. I want to reiterate this, the United States is torturing people in a secret prison in Poland without trial, if that doesn't have a NAZI connotation nothing does.

Our policies of enhanced interigation is the very thing we fought against in WWII

So to conclude, to uphold the principles and the ideals that make America great, vote in the Affirmation and end this unconstitutional and immoral practice.
