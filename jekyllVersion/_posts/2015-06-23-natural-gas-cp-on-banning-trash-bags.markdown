Would you ban the use of coal? What about wind power? What about Nuclear Energy? So what do all of these things have in common with Plastic bags?

There is an old saying, "For every problem there is an opportunity" in my speech I will outline and describe an environmentally concerned alternative to banning plastic bags.

(I parrot Senator â€¦'s contention about the economic benefits of plastic bags and I hope I can convince those on the negation that there is an environmentally-friendly alternative to banning plastic bags where we have both the economic benefits and be more environmentally conscious)

According to Discovery News on May 6 2015, only 1% of Swedish trash ends up in a landfill the rest is split between evenly between recycling and burning. In contrast to the United States which Lehigh University estimates 55% ends up in landfills and only 14% is burned. In fact Huffington Post reports in 2012 that Sweden imported 800,000 tons of trash, such as plastic bags, that year alone to burn it. So why does Sweden burn trash and doesn't it release harmful toxins into the air?

When trash is burned it releases one third the energy pound for pound as natural gas said Goran Skoglund, media spokesperson for Oresundskraft a Swedish Waste to Energy company.

The heat and steam given off are used to spin turbines which creates around 8.5 percent of the total energy used in Sweden, and considering the United States gets around 4% of its energy this way already if rather than trying to ban trash we try to increase our use of trash in the energy industry we can take the estimated 4% of United States energy produced to around 16% since only one-fourth of trash we have available goes to burning currently the rest goes to landfills.

And as for environmental concerns we would be producing roughly 17% more carbon dioxide per megawatt than coal by burning trash but we'd be cutting down on Methane.

You see 18% of the methane produced in the United States is a result of our landfills, when micro organisms start to consume our trash they give off methane, so while on the surface burning waste, such as plastic bags, sounds like it would be harmful to the environment it would actually be greener to burn it because it would be cutting down on Methane which is far more destructive to our environment than carbon dioxide. So it would actually be greener to burn the trash.

In conclusion why ban a substance which can be used to produce energy, vote in the negation because there is an environmentally friendly alternative to banning plastic bags that doesn't violate the economic benefits.
