I have a question, who owns your body?

In my speech I will answer that question and I will go over how this bill protects American's right to life, liberty and property and afterwards I will address the concerns of the Negation.

The answer to the question is obvious; you do. And therefore your body is your property and you are guaranteed property rights.

Now to address the how this bill affects our natural rights, chiefly the right to property. As addressed at the beginning of the speech an individuals body is their property and as Armen Alchian from the University of California, Los Angelos, writes in his book _Property Rights_ that "Private property rights are the rights of humans to use specified goods and to exchange them" and "Any restraint on them shifts the balance of power toward behavior that political authorities approve." In other words someone's property is their own and they can do what they want to with it, otherwise we are depriving individuals of themselves and strengthening the Governments hold over the people.

The Negation is concerned with one of a number of things primarily self-medication. But the risk of abuse is worth it, because liberty itself is risky. And when we no longer are willing to take risks to preserve life liberty and property is the day you will see my resignation from this office because this government would therefor no longer promote the values from its origin and those values is what sets the United States apart from the rest of the world.

When someone buys an oral contraception can you demonstrate to me who is the victim. Without a clear victim it is illogical for it to illegal to buy an oral contraceptive. Their body is their own property therefor those on the affirmitive must believe the federal government has legal possession over the bodies of its constitutents and the see themselves as the victims due to the reduction in value of their property.

In Conclusion this bill cuts back the restrictions we as a government have created for the American people, restores life liberty and property and as such I ask you, I plead with you to affirm this bill
