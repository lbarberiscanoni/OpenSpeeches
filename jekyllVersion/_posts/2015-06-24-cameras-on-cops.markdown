In 2011, Rialto, California, police responded to a 911 call about a mentally disturbed man with a gun in a parked car. When they got there and confronted him, they ended up shooting him. 50 yards away, a man shot a video from his balcony and posted it online; titling it "Officers shoot unarmed man". However, the police were wearing cameras that clearly showed the man with a gun, which wasn't visible on the witness's recording. This is just one example of why we need to affirm this resolution to have police officers wear cameras, in order to lessen excessive force and build trust between citizens and police officers.
