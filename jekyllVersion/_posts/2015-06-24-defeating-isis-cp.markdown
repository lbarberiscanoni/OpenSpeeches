ISIS has been increasingly becoming more and more destructive in the Middle East. The governments there either can't or won't take action against them, so the region just keeps getting more unstable. Unless we take action against them, they will continue to advance through the Middle East. We must affirm this bill because it takes the most necessary and effective actions to stop the Islamic State, most notably, the actions taken against their oil installations.

All organizations need money to function. This applies especially to an extremely large group such as ISIS, which has to buy a lot of weapons and vehicles. They get their funds through extortion and selling oil. They have a lot of territory in Iraq, which has 4% of the world's oil. One way they use this money is by paying high wages, which makes soldiers desert other Syrian rebel groups and join ISIS. Oil infrastructure will be easy to get rid of because it is hard to keep well hidden and hard to move. The United States and its allies have already bombed several of the oil deposits fairly easily. If we can continue to remove them, then ISIS will lose a lot of their funding, which will make them significantly less powerful in the region.

Training the Peshmerga forces will also be a great help to the cause. The Peshmerga forces are the military forces of Iraqi Kurdistan. Recently, ISIS forces have been gaining territory closer and closer to Kurdish lands. The current US airstrike campaign has helped the Peshmerga forces fight back against ISIS, since they provide the ground troops that can finish the job after our aerial attacks. Masrour Barzani, the chancellor of the Kurdish region security council, told the Guardian that they had asked the UK for weaponry. They sent some machine guns but denied a lot of what he asked for. They aren't getting much help from any other countries, but with help they can be a big part of the fight against ISIS. Even though the bill doesn't give weapons, giving military training to more efficiently use weapons and other things will help them be better soldiers and will be cheaper than us supplying weapons.

This bill points out the specific actions we need to take in order to stop ISIS. It will take out their main source of funding and help us have more powerful allies. For this, we must affirm.
