The origins of the U.S. military bases in Okinawa seem obvious. They were built to react to activity in the Soviet Union, and later on, in China. People want to get rid of these bases because of the lack of need for them and the resentment they build, but disagree with those reasons. We must stand in negation of this resolution because the bases are necessary to protect Japan from a looming threat: North Korea.

For too long, North Korea has been looked at as a joke in the eyes of the international community. And certain aspects of it, admittedly, do seem ridiculous from the outside. But they do still pose an international threat. In 2013, the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet hinted at a new threat to American warships. They requested money for new missile defense systems to be built in a hurry. There is suspicion that the threat was North Korean cruise missiles, based on North Korean footage of these weapons. Besides that, we also have instances such as the sinking of the ROKS _Cheonan_ sinking in 2010, a South Korean ship hit with North Korean torpedoes.

It is no secret that North Korea has been conducting nuclear tests. There is a very real possibility of North Korea having extremely destructive weapons, and there is a very real chance that they will use them. We already have to be protecting our own ships in the Pacific Ocean, but we have to be protecting Japan as well. The U.S. has bases in South Korea, which are primarily for defense against North Korea; if we shut down Okinawan bases, the South Korean bases will be burdened with protecting the whole Asian Pacific region, which they can't handle.

Even if the residents of Okinawa don't realize it, they need to be protected from one of the greatest threats in their region. Fewer bases might make the North Korean government more reckless, and more likely to start major conflicts. For this reason, we cannot shut down Okinawan bases until North Korea no longer poses a threat.
