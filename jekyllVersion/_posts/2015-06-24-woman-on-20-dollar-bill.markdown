Lately, the campaign to get a woman on the 20 dollar bill has made national news. And why shouldn't it? I mean, yes, Andrew Jackson was definitely not a great choice for the spot. And yes, a woman on a widely used piece of currency would make much more of a statement than Sacagawea did on the dollar coin. However, the criteria given by the resolution don't allow much room for many influential women in American history. We must negate this resolution because the criteria put extreme limits on who can be put on the 20 dollar bill.

The Woman on the 20s campaign conducted a poll a few months ago to see which woman the American people wanted on the 20 dollar bill. The winner was Harriet Tubman. A great choice, definitely. A symbol for the freeing of the slaves. However, according to the requirements put forth by the resolution, she isn't allowed to be on it, since she didn't hold an elected federal office. In fact, most women who were involved in any kind of civil rights movement can't be on it, either. People such as Rosa Parks or Susan B. Anthony, extremely important women, didn't hold these positions either. One could make an argument for Eleanor Roosevelt. However, First Lady wouldn't count as an "elected official", seeing as how it was her husband who got elected. The first female chief of the Cherokee nation, Wilma Mankiller, was also a finalist, and also doesn't fit the requirements, not only because she didn't hold an elected federal office, but because she died in 2010, nowhere near the 20 years in the resolution.

Which other women haven't been dead long enough, though? The 4 women who have served on the Supreme Court come to mind, but all 4 are still alive. Regardless of your opinions on Hillary Clinton, she did serve in an office, but is still alive. Dianne Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, Sarah Palin, Barbara Boxer, all elected officials, and all still alive. The fact that the campaign to get a woman on the 20 is only happening now should show that women have only been heavily involved in politics recently enough for none of them to have been dead for 20 years.

While I do agree that Andrew Jackson should be removed, and I do believe he should be replaced by a woman, none of the most obvious choices are available to put on the $20 bill. It is because the resolution eliminates so many choices that we must negate.
