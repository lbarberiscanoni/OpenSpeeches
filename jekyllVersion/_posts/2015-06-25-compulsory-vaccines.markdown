1.	Unvaccinated children are infringing upon the safety and rights of others. While the Constitution does guarantee liberty, this liberty only goes up to the point where it infringes upon another’s rights or security. Parents have the right to raise their children however they wish until it infringes upon another’s rights or security – this is why child abuse is illegal, because it infringes upon the safety of the child. Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children are exercising their right to raise their child however they wish, but the problem arises when the unvaccinated child puts other children in danger.

2.	The time has come to address this federally. Historically, the preservation of the public health has been the primary responsibility of state and local governments, and the authority to enact laws relevant to the protection of the public health derives from the state’s general police powers.
