Compulsory voting would ensure equal representation. William A Galston of the Brookings Institute tells us on November 5, 2011, that ideally, a democracy will take into account the interests and views of all citizens. But if some regularly vote while others don’t, officials are likely to give greater weight to participants. This might not matter much if nonparticipants were evenly distributed through the population; however, people with lower levels of income and education are less likely to vote, as are young adults and recent first-generation immigrants. Compulsory voting would tend to even out disparities stemming from income, education and age, enhancing our system’s inclusiveness.

Compulsory voting can help depolarise American politics. Hard-core partisans are more likely to dominate lower-turnout elections, while those who are less fervent about specific issues and less attached to political organizations tend not to participate at levels proportional to their share of the electorate, according to Eric Liu of TIME Magazine on August 12, 2012. If the full range of voters actually voted, our political leaders (which includes us), who are exquisitely attuned followers, would go where the votes are: away from the extremes. And they would become more responsive to the younger, poorer and less educated Americans who don’t currently vote.
