85% of high school seniors consider marijuana easy to obtain, according to the federally funded organisation Monitoring the Future. This figure hasn’t changed since 1975. The Global Commission on Drug Policy tells us in February 2015 that the Drug War has built massive criminal empires, killed millions of people, wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, and failed to solve the problem.

1.	The war on drugs leads to high incarceration rates. The United States has 5% of the world’s people, but 25% of the world’s prison inmates. One of the main reasons for this extraordinarily high incarceration rate is the war on drugs, where simple possession of drugs may be considered a felony. The US Bureau of Justice shows that almost half of our prison inmates are in jail for drug-related charges. Keeping all these people imprisoned costs our country $74 billion in 2007, according to the US Bureau of Justice, and Adam Liptak of the New York Times tells us in 2010 that the cost grows annually by 10%. 

2.	Racism. Although rates of drug use and selling are comparable across racial lines, people of color are far more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, prosecuted, convicted and incarcerated for drug law violations than are whites. The Huffington Post of April 2013 tells us that the punishment for drug-related charges falls disproportionately on people of color. African Americans are arrested 13 times more than whites on drug charges, with some states going up to 57 times, although the rates of use are roughly equal. Black kids are 10 times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes than white ones -- even though white kids are more likely to abuse drugs. Higher arrest and incarceration rates for African Americans and Latinos are not reflective of increased prevalence of drug use or sales in these communities, but rather of a law enforcement focus on urban areas, on lower-income communities and on communities of color as well as inequitable treatment by the criminal justice system, according to the Drug Policy Alliance.

Washington Post Feb 12, 2015 -  Colorado retailers sold $386 million of medical marijuana and $313 million for purely recreational purposes. The two segments of the market generated $63 million in tax revenue, with an additional $13 million collected in licenses and fees. (about Colorado’s marijuana sales)
