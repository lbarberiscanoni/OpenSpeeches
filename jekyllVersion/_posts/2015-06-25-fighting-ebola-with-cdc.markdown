The bill is far too late. World Net Daily tells us on January 3, 2015 that the United Nations has set a goal to see the number of cases reduce to zero by year-end 2015, according to Anthony Banbury of the U.N.’s Ebola response team. Supporting the idea the Ebola outbreak in West Africa can be eradicated during 2015, the United Nations noted the number of cases in Sierra Leone over a three-week period has fallen below 1,000 for the first time since Sept. 28, suggesting the spread of the disease is slowing. Ebola is presumably the cause of this bill’s proposal, since it is the biggest disease problem present today, but section 4 of the bill gives us a time frame from this year to 2019. If Ebola is to be eradicated by the end of this year, that means 3 years of money that’s not going to go where it’s needed.
