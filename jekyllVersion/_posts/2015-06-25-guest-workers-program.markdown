I applaud the intent of representatives on the affirmative side to help people wishing to come to the United States from developing countries. However, this bill does nothing but the opposite of helping them â€“ this bill not only entraps workers, but also has no real accountability.

This bill entraps workers. The guest worker program proposed in this bill makes a promise it cannot and does not intend to keep. Section 1 tells us that the work visas can be renewed every 2 years for a maximum of 6 years; however, one must live in the United States for at least 7 years to be eligible for a green card. Because of this, workers in the US under this program will not be able to get green cards on their way to citizenship like they intend to. Furthermore, because the visa holders are chosen by random lottery, if someone signs up for the lottery but does not get chosen, they have declared their illegal or temporary status for all to hear and will, almost certainly, be deported as soon as their time runs out. Finally, this bill does not extend to families, so even if a worker got chosen by the lottery to receive a work visa, he or she must either leave their family behind in their native country or bring them in illegally.

The Bracero Program. The Bracero Program was a guest worker program created in 1942 to keep American agriculture productive. The program was specifically directed at rural workers from Mexico, many of them experienced farm workers. The program recruited many people from Mexico for over 20 years. According to the Constitutional Rights Foundation, in 1959, a record number of 430,000 braceros were employed within the United States. An estimated 80,000 braceros were coming into the United States each year through El Paso, Texas, alone. Across the border from El Paso, the Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez served as a major recruiting centre for braceros. Before entering the United States, each worker reported to a recruiting centre and signed a contract with a U.S. employer. By 1964, however, there had been numerous reports that the braceros were underpaid, overworked, harassed, and housed in poor living conditions. The U.S. Department of Labor officer in charge of the program called it "legalized slavery.
