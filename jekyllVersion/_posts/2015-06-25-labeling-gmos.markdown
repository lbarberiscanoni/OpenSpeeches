My mother always says that her dream is to own a farm and grow her own organic, non-modified food. Because of this, she spends hours at a time outside, tending to her vegetable garden to grow healthy food for her family. While there is no real evidence that shows GMOs are harmful, people like my mother deserve to know what is in her food, at least.

Our people want GMOs to be labelled. According to Allison Kopicki of the New York Times on July 17, 2013, 93 percent of respondents to a New York Times poll said that foods containing such ingredients should be identified. Half said that they would not eat genetically modified vegetables, foods, and grains. They were even less comfortable about eating meat from genetically engineered animals: three-quarters said they would not eat G.M.O. fish, and about two-thirds said they would not eat meat that had been modified. We are here to represent our constituence, and if they call for these foods to be labelled, who are we to object?

The majority of developed countries around the world label GMOs. According to the Centre for Food Safety, 64 nations, including 15 members of the European Union, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Russia, and China label their genetically modified foods.

We already do things similar to labelling GMOs. Labelling GMOs is akin to listing ingredients on a package or marking food as kosher or not – it’s there for the people who need to know. If Americans don’t want to eat GMOs, we should tell them what is genetically modified
