The all-volunteer force is sufficient and well-trained. Melvin R Laird, secretary of defense from 1969 to 1973, tells us on February 21, 2013 in the Washington Post that each year almost 300,000 young men and women volunteer for active duty, the reserves and the National Guard or are commissioned as officers. 2012 marked the 27th consecutive year in which the Pentagon has exceeded its quality standards for active-duty recruits. Half of all recruits are in the top two of the Armed Forces Qualification Testâ€™s five categories, with only 1 percent in the lowest, whereas in the last year of the draft, only one-third of recruits were in the top two categories, with 25 percent in the lowest. While only three-quarters of youths nationwide graduate from high school, all military recruits are required to have graduated. (During the last year of the draft, only half of recruits were high school graduates.)
