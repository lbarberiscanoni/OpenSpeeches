A tipping point in Chinamerica relations could be approaching. Mark J Valencia, a maritime policy analyst, political commentator and consultant focused on Asia, tells us on September 1, 2014, that, after the August encounter between a US Navy surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet over the South China Sea, many analysts have warned of a tipping point in China-US relations beyond which the two conclude that conflict is unavoidable. Such a clash would not be a new phenomenon â€“ in classic realist theory, established powers strive to preserve the status quo that assures their position at the top of the hierarchy and view emerging powers as potential threats. Rising powers feel constrained and strive to stretch the sinews of the international system. Because of this, there needs to be an effort to take precautions, should this tipping point occur.

China has technology to attack the United States. According to a paper issued by the Centre for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs at the National Defence University in 2014, saturation strikes from Chinese anti-ship cruise missiles could become the biggest threat to US Navy carrier strike groups. Due to the low cost of developing, deploying and maintaining cruise missiles, the Chinese believe that cruise missiles possess a 9:1 cost advantage over the expense of defending against them, believing that quantity can defeat quality. Once again, if China is capable of successfully attacking the United States, we need to take steps to defend against any action, should it occur.
