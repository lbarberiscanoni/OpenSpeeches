Password-protected websites are property. Just as much as a safe and everything inside it should be considered secure and private, a password-protected account on the internet should also be considered secure and private, as a December 17, 2013 article from The Atlantic asserts. 

Unwarranted searching of password-protected accounts violates the 4th amendment. The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, the very document that we have sworn to uphold, protects residents from unwarranted search and seizure of their persons, houses, papers, and effects. Information and correspondence stored online are personal papers, so to speak, that just happen to be recorded digitally rather than physically, and should be protected in just the same way. The Washington Post of June 21, 2013 tells us that in no way does the digital essence of these materials preclude their standing as personal and private effects of our citizens. Because of this, any kind of unwarranted intrusion into password-protected websites is unconstitutional.
