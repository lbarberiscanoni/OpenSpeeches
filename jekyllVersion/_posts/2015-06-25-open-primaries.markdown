Self-determination. Samuel Isscharoff, law professor at NYU and author of The Law of Democracy, tells us that open primaries lead to a strategy known as "raiding," in which voters aligned with one party decide en masse to cast their vote for the weakest candidate of the other party. When it works correctly, the raiders' true candidate will face off against a non-threatening opponent in the general election. This thwarts the will of a political party to determine for itself, by members who are devoted to its ideals, which candidate will be their official representative for the fall campaign. Instead, it's possible a winner could be chosen by people with no interest in the long-term well being of the party in question. If this should happen, it basically negates the purpose of the political party.

Third-party candidates still wonâ€™t get the vote. On October 16, 2014, NPR states that many open primaries have a feature called top two vote getters, which means that only the top two candidates advance to the general election. Since smaller, third party candidates rarely, if ever, manage to get their choice into the top positions of an open primary election, the party essentially finds itself shut out from the election process no matter which way they turn.
