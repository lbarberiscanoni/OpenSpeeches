I stand in firm negation of this bill for the very people it is trying to assist – those making minimum wage. Passing this piece of legislation would actually be very detrimental to minimum-wage workers because it could result in layoffs, fewer hirings, and price increases of consumer goods.

Layoffs. A February 25, 2013 article from USNews tells us that if an employer has a tight compensation budget and the minimum wage is raised, it means they can no longer compensate the same number of employees at a higher rate and must make layoffs to remain within budget. So, while some employees may be making slightly more money, others will be left unemployed, ultimately harming people who already make little as it is.

Fewer hirings. If business must pay their minimum wage employees more, they cannot afford to hire as many employees. According to a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago study from 2006, “10 percent increase in the minimum wage lowers low skill employment by 2 to 4 percent and total restaurant employment by 1 to 3 percent.” With this piece of legislation, we’re increasing the minimum wage by about 43%. Or instead of hiring fewer employees, the company may start outsourcing jobs to employees in countries that are willing to work for much less than $10.10 per hour, resulting in fewer jobs for Americans. Outsourcing is already enough of a problem for the unskilled job market as it is, and we can’t afford to let our constituency suffer even more.

Price increases. Employers might raise prices of their product in order to generate enough income to support their more highly paid minimum wage employees, which could ultimately create a ripple effect for other shops and industries, resulting in a slightly higher cost of living, resulting in another push to raise minimum wage again. For example, in response to a minimum wage hike in California, restaurants such as Jack in the Box and Cheesecake Factory all were forced to raise their prices to compensate, according to a February 24, 2014 article in Bloomberg Businessweek. This, once again, harms the minimum wage workers.

Senators, we are here to represent our constituency. Passing this bill would be to the detriment of our people, for the three reasons that it would lead to layoffs, fewer hirings, and price increases. Stand with me and negate for the good of our people.
