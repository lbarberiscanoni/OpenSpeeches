Example: Ebola. As one of the diseases most prevalent on our TV screens today, Ebola provides a good example for the ethics of untested medication. BBC News tells us on August 12, 2014 that untested drugs can be used to treat patients infected with the Ebola virus, the World Health Organization says. It was ethical in light of the scale of the outbreak and high number of deaths - more than 1,000 people have died in West Africa. The Liberian government said it was aware of the risks associated with Zmapp, the untested drug considered as an Ebola treatment but the alternative was to allow many more people to die. "The alternative for not testing this is death, a certain death," Information Minister Lewis Brown told the BBC. "This is not even the rock and the hard place for us. We think those who have been infected should be given the chance to have that tested on them if they give their consent to do so. "We know there may be risks associated with it," the minister added, "but choosing a risk and choosing dying I am sure many would prefer to see that risk happen".

While Ebola may be the biggest concern as a disease that requires untested drugs, the same rationale applies to people with terminal diseases or conditions that current, tested drugs don’t work on. If the person needing the untested medicine asks for it, it’s their choice to make, and if the medicine does work, we’d be helping the American people.
