Subsidies are important for energy. Edward Guinness, Co-Manager of the Guinness Alternative Energy Fund at Guinness Atkinson Funds, tells us in Oct. 29, 2007 that government subsidies allow the industry to grow, technology to be developed, and costs to be kept down. Furthermore, alternative energy is most developed in countries where government subsidies have been in place for some time – for example, Germany put in place strong incentives in the early part of this decade to encourage demand for solar modules, to encourage installations of wind farms and to support the biofuels industry. Companies in countries with a more progressive alternative energy policy framework therefore developed technology and intellectual property at an earlier state. Other European countries such as Denmark, Spain and Portugal also embraced alternative energy therefore companies tend to be more mature in Europe. 

Solar power has become more viable with the use of subsidies. The New York Times of November 2014 tells us that according to a study by the investment banking firm Lazard, the cost of utility­scale solar energy is as low as 5.6 cents a kilowatt­hour.  In comparison, natural gas comes at 6.1 cents a kilowatt­hour on the low end and coal at 6.6 cents. Without subsidies, however, the firm’s analysis shows, solar costs about 7.2 cents a kilowatt­hour at the low end,  making it more costly and therefore less likely to be used than non-renewable resources.
