I’m a Tumblr girl. Parts of it I love – the fandoms and the humour. Parts of it I don’t understand – quality blogs. And parts of it I abhor – Social Justice blogs. Now, I’m not saying I’m against any of the issues they support, but when there is a wise consensus that I have Asian privilege and have never experienced discrimination due to my race…nope. Race isn’t the issue – economic status is. 

The present race-based system extends racism. Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution writes in his 2004 book, Affirmative Action Around the World – an Empirical Study that preferences primarily benefit middle and upper class minorities, often even hurting many poor whites and Asians, in essence exerting some form of reverse discrimination. Also, members of minority groups run the risk of being victimized by peers or professors who may believe that their success is unearned. In addition, affirmative action is extremely racist to minorities, because it is either assuming that all members of a minority are either impoverished or lacking in intelligence, which is obviously not true. It is also condescending because it is assuming that members in a minority need affirmative action to get into college. A racist past cannot be undone through more racism. David Sacks and Peter Thiel, co-authors of The Diversity Myth: “Multi-culturalism” and the Politics of Intolerance at Stanford ace-conscious programs betray Martin Luther King’s dream of a colour-blind community, and the heightened racial sensitivity they cause is a source of acrimony and tension instead of healing.

Poverty is the strongest factor in determining education. Rebecca Klein of the Huffington Post tells us on October 14, 2014, that a report released earlier this month by the research branch of the nonprofit National Student Clearinghouse, which examined data from more than 3.5 million high school graduates, found that poverty was a key factor in determining graduation and college enrolment. For example, college enrolment rates for students from high-income schools ranged from 61 percent to 73 percent. For students from low-income schools, college enrolment rates ranged from 47 percent to 58 percent. Often, college education is key to finding good beneficial employment, and many of these students who don’t get degrees fall back into the poverty cycle.
