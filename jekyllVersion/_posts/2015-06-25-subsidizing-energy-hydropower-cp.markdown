I used to live in Rochester, New York, a city that should be famous for Eastman School of Music, the Lilac Festival, and the Erie Canal. Okay, that’s just a New York thing. But with the Erie Canal Bike trail and towns with names like Fairport and Pittsford, you get a healthy affection and appreciation for water.

Renewable energy is very viable, specifically hydropower. Robert Rapier, chief technology officer and executive vice president at Merica International, a forestry and renewable energy company, tells us in April 2013 that hydropower currently provides about 16% of the world's electricity, which is greater than the percentage produced by nuclear power, and a far greater share than all other renewables combined. In fact, the largest power plant by capacity in the world, as well as four of the five largest power plants in the world are hydroelectric plants. Furthermore, wave energy research and deployment in the US is only increasing, according to a September 3, 2012 New York Times article from Kirk Johnson. Oregon, for example, has produced multiple wave energy devices capable of powering 100 homes each. Putting more money into research will increase this potential. Because of this, we can’t end all subsidies to clean energy.

Government subsidies are important. Some examples of successful and necessary subsidies are our system of public higher education, which required massive public investment, and information technology, which would not have grown to the size it is without large scale subsidies from the Defence Department that supported the semiconductor and computer companies in 1950s and 1960s.

While Lorenzo makes fun of my New York Accent (I have absolutely no idea what he’s talking about), water power has been important to humanity since the first watermill was built, and will continue to be so.
