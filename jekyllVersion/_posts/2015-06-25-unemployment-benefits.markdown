Increasing unemployment benefits leads to more proactive jobseekers. According to a December 5, 2012 article on NPR, a study by the John J. Heldrich Centre for Workforce Development of Rutgers University shows that people receiving unemployment benefits are more likely to be proactive about looking for work than those who did not receive benefits. They also reported more hours devoted to the job search and they were twice as likely to take on a job with lower pay than people who didn’t receive benefits – 59% as opposed to 30%. 

Long-term unemployment today is a greater issue than it has ever been before. Sarah Ayres Steinberg of the Centre for American Progress tells us on January 10, 2014 that the long-term unemployment rate is higher than ever before at 37.7% of unemployed people who stayed unemployed for six months or more. Furthermore, the typical unemployed worker has been out of work longer than ever before – the median duration of unemployment is 17 weeks, a stark increase from even March of 2004 – 10 weeks. This continues a trend that’s been seen since at least March of 1973. Finally, more unemployed workers are running out of benefits than ever before, at 44.5%, once again continuing the trend. By giving unemployed workers a larger window to obtain unemployment benefits, we can reduce the duration as well as the numbers of long – term unemployment.
