Congressional Debate is a simulation of a legislative day divided into 2 sessions of about 3 hours each. 

At the beginning of each session a student gets elected by his fellow competitors to be the “presiding officer” (PO) and  call on speakers fairly. (for our tournament purposes, we will get an experienced competitor to preside)

Each student, if called on by the Presider after standing up, has 3 minutes to give a speech about a bill or resolution at hand. 
After each speech, the speaker is going to be “cross-examined” for 1 minute by his fellow competitors selected by the PO. This cross examination time is divided in 30 seconds segment per questioner, in which the questioner and the speaker will interact back and forth. The only exception to this format is the cross examination after the first Affirmative speech on each bill and the first Negative, for they will have 2 minutes of cross examination as opposed to just 1 minute as explained above. 

While the PO will be judged based on his or her ability to effectively run the session, the speakers will be judged on their ability to effectively play the role of a Senator or House Representative, on the content of their speech, on their style of presentation, and on their activity and presence within the chamber. All students receive one score per speech from 1 to 6, 6 being the best. 
At the end of each session, each judge will rank the top 6 competitors independently of their speech scores, and the lowest cumulative rank at the end of the day will place the highest.

There is also a “Parliamentarian” that stays for the whole day serves the dual function to resolve disputes within parliamentary motions and procedure, as well as breaking ties with his or her rank given at the end of the whole day. It also collects votes at the end of the day to elect the “Best Presiding Officer Award”.

Here are few things to keep in mind going forward:

1. Factors considered in judging
	* Quality of Speeches
	* Quantity of Speeches
	* Activity in the chamber IE questions

2. Research strategies
	* Answer the 3 questions
	* What is going on
	* Build a base on info to seek further info
	* Consult an encyclopedia
	* What is at stake
	* Practical matters
	* Moral questions
	* Where do I stand
	* Craft a legitimate position on the issue
	* Search for relevant articles on the subject
	* Familiarize with the relevant literature
	* Mark up the article and take good notes
	* Figure out responses to the anticipated arguments others will make on your weaknesses

3. Argument strategies
	* Your job is to persuade the judge
	* Political issues are questions of right and wrong
	* Moral questions are prior but equally important as the stock issues
	* You only connect with people with a discussion of human dignity
	* Argues so that the judge is forced to have a stake in what you are saying
	* Lead meaningfully with your presence within the chamber
